Initially received in the. fresh state for frozen section analysis is a portion of pancreas, 2.0 cm in length and 2.0 x 3.4 cm. A suture. marks the new margin which is additionally marked blue. The new margin is trimmed and submitted en. face for frozen section analysis with residual frozen tissue submitted in C1 for permanent sections. The. pancreatic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and probe patent. Sectioning demonstrates yellow-gray glandular. parenchyma with mild hemorrhagic congestion and without grossly residual tumor. The remainder of the. pancreas is submitted in a sequential fashion, proximal (old margin) to distal (new margin) in C2-C5. A. scant amount of peripancreatic fat is examined and is suspicious for discrete lymph node content,. sectioned and submitted in C6. Intraoperative Diagnosis: A. Whipple contents: Pancreatic margin positive for adenocarcinoma, bile duct margin is negative for. carcinoma. C. New pancreatic margin: Negative for carcinoma,. intraoperative interpretation(s). was/were performed and rendered at. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled Whipple contents. Received in formalin, is a generous portion of tissue. consistent with a Whipple procedure specimen: a distal resection of stomach, 5.7 cm lesser, 11.0 cm. greater, a 25.5 cm length of duodenum averaging 3.3 cm in diameter, and the pancreas includes the. head measuring 2.4 cm in length, 4.6 cm superior-inferior. and 4.6 cm anterior-posterior/ uncinate margin. The gastric and small bowel segment demonstrates a semi-congested, light pink to deep red appearance. The pancreas is palpably soft to dense towards the superior-posterior periphery. The margins of the. pancreas are now differentially inked as follows: Anterior surface: Yellow,. Inferior surface: Green,. Superior margin: Blue,. Posterior margin/uncinate: Black,. Printed: This report continues. Acct No. Pathology Report - Page 3/5. Page 3 Doc# 1. FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. Pancreatic notch surface: Red. The common bile duct extends 1.3 and 0.9 cm in diameter, with a probe patent lumen into the smail. bowel segment. The pancreatic duct is unable to probe for patency with the CBD or small bowel lumen. The distal pancreatic margin is trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on one chuck. with the residual frozen tissue submitted in A1 for permanent sections; the common bile duct margin is. trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on a second chuck with the residual frozen. tissue submitted in A2 for permanent sections. The gastric and small bowel segments are now opened; the luminal contents are cleared revealing. semi-congested, light pink to proximally deep red, gastric mucosa without discrete lesion. The small bowel. segment demonstrates prominent, light pink and tan, circular plica that is increasingly softened and. congested toward the distal margin of resection. The ampulla of Vater is oriented 5.3 cm distal to the. pylorus and greater than 18.0 cm from the distal small bowel margin of resection. The ampulla. demonstrates slightly raised and granular appearance. Initial sectioning through the pancreas reveals an. ill-defined, dense, grossly fibrotic, light gray and pink, mass lesion, measuring upwards of 3.0 x 2.3 x 1.8. cm, and predominantly positioned in the superior-posterior aspect of the pancreas, within 0.1 cm of the. superior, 0.3 cm of the posterior, 0.7 cm of the anterior margins, and within 0.1 cm of the surface of the. pancreatic notch. The mass lesion appears to abut the common bile duct, however, the mucosa is. glistening to wrinkled, light gray and deep red, without gross involvement. The lesion is grossly within 0.1. cm of the distal pancreatic margin, formally removed for frozen section analysis. The pancreatic duct. narrows to 0.1 cm towards the small bowel length and is possibly obliterated by tumor. The grossly. uninvolved pancreas demonstrates a pronounced, lobular-glandular, pink-yellow gross architecture, that. becomes increasingly fatty towards the inferior anterior periphery. Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveais twelve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.15 cm. to 1.5 cm, rubbery, light gray to deep red. Initial examination of the perigastric fat does not reveal. additional lymph node candidacy. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. F/S LEFT UPPER LOBE NODULE: (Frozen Section). - Predominantly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma with focus of invasion. (acinar pattern). Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. ADDENDUM # 2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS and EGFR were sent on. or patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM 3: Genzyme Specimen #: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable. mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine. kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of. mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical. sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa(r)). Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)). Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A. was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical. significance. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection.

However, tumor does not invade directly into the adrenal gland. Tumor is also present within the renal sinus. adipose tissue. The renal vein is free of tumor. The lymph nodes are extensively involved by chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stain for EMA is strongly positive in the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 is positive in a minority of the tumor. CD10 is focally positive, including rare cells that show a membranous staining pattern. Vimentin is negative. Electron microscopy shows that the tumor is made of cuboidal cells with abundant cytoplasm containing a large number of. mitochondria with tubular cristae. The cytoplasm contains a large number of microvesicles. The ultrastructural features of the. tumor are those of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic variant. The electron microscopy was performed by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (A) LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL, AND PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE - A radical nephrectomy specimen consisting of a left kidney. (28.0 X 17.0 X 10.0 cm) and associated adrenal gland (7.0 X 4.0 X 1.5 cm). Within the renal hilum is an aggregate of enlarged. lymph nodes (8.0 X 3.5 X 2.0 cm). Within the upper pole and mid-portion of kidney is an 11.0 X 9.0 X 6.0 cm, lobulated, relatively well-circumscribed tumor. which extends through the renal capsule into the perinephric fat, including around the adrenal gland. The tumor grossly involves. the renal sinus. The cut surface of the tumor has a variegated appearance, with tan-pink fleshy areas as well as gray-brown. necrotic areas (necrotic areas comprise less than 10% of tumor). Other areas have thickened gray-white fibrous septa which. traverse the tumor. The ureteral and vascular margins are grossly free of tumor. The renal vein is free of tumor. Three hilar lymph. nodes are grossly involved with tumor and measure 4.8 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm, 2.5 X 2.0 X 2.8 cm, and 1.6 X 1.0 X 1.0 cm, respectively. The cut surface of the positive lymph nodes have a pink-tan fleshy appearance. The renal tissue away from the tumor is pale brown and unremarkable. The cortex has a thickness of 0.8 cm, and the. corticomedullary junction is well-delineated.

LIVER, 1300 GRAMS, LEFT HEPATECTOMY: - MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, AT LEAST. 14 CM, ARISING IN A HEPATOCELLULAR ADENOMA ADENOMA, 17.3. - THE RESECTION MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; CARCINOMA IS. 0.7CM FROM THE RESECTION MARGIN. CARCINOMA INVADES INTO THE LIVER CAPSULE. - PERICAPSULAR ORGANIZING AND FIBROUS ADHESIONS TO SMOOTH. MUSCLE OF GASTRIC WALL; NO GASTRIC MUCOSA PRESENT. - NO HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA IS SEEN IN THE ORGANIZING FIBROUS. ADHESIONS OR THE GASTRIC WALL. - MULTI-FOCAL SMALL AND LARGE VENOUS INVASION IS PRESENT. - PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGE: pT3A Nx Mx Stage IIIA. - NON NEOPLASTIC LIVER. - MILD PORTAL INFLAMMATION. - NO SIGNIFICANT PORTAL FIBROSIS. - MARKED TELANGIECTASIA AND CONGESTION. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is largely replaced by a hepatocellular. neoplasm with a heterogenous appearance, grossly and histologically. The. liver tumor is multinodular with areas of extensive hemorrhage and necrosis. The malignant hepatocytes are arranged in thickened cords with nuclear. atypia and mitosis with some areas of classical trabecular HCC. Areas of. extensive pseudoglandular architecture are also present as are areas of. diffuse intracytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions, resulting in a signet ring cell like. morphology. There are also extensive steatotic neoplastic hepatocytes with. cytoplasmic bile inclusions as well as some malignant cells with Mallory. hyaline. In some of the slightly more peripheral nodules, benign hepatocytes. have areas of FNH like architecture with proliferating ductules along fibrous. septa. In one of these foci, a nodule of definite HCC is present. Multifocal. venous invasion is seen (large and small) with at least one nodule of HCC. adhering to the endothelium. Areas of the nodules lack the cytologic and. architectural atypia to be considered HCC and appear to represent the. background adenoma. Immunohistochemical characterization is similarly heterogenous with areas of. steatotic hepatocytes within the nodule expressing amyloid A stain while other. areas with the FNH like architecture are negative for amyloid A. Glutamine. synthetase has a geographic staining pattern in apparently hepatocellular. adenoma like areas, with strong diffuse staining in steatotic and trabecular. HCC. Glypican 3 is negative throughout, while HSP 70 is positive in trabecular. HCC (focally in the same area as the glutamine synthetase). The non-neoplastic liver has intact architecture (supported by trichrome and. reticulin stains) with mild portal inflammation and patchy portal fibrosis. The. lobules have marked sinusoidal dilatation and congestion without other. significant inflammatory changes or steatosis. DPAS and Iron stains have no. significant positivity. Hepatitis B core and surface antigen stains are negative. INTERPRETATION: The findings are most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma arising. in a hepatocellular adenoma. The non-neoplastic liver lacks features of chronic. hepatitis or cirrhosis. SYNOPTIC SUMMARY. Procedure: Partial hepatectomy. Major hepatectomy (3 segments or more). Specimen: Liver.

COMMENT: All three tumor resection specimens contain multiple papillary neoplams. In parts A and F, the dominant. tumors are composed of papillary excrescences lined by realatively small cuboidal to low-columnar cells. with primarily clear cytoplasm. The epithelial cell nuclei are moderately enlarged and round to oval with. small nucleoli. The papillae contain fibrovascular cores, some with prominant foamy macrophages. The. histology is that of type I papillary carcinoma. Hemorrhage and psammoma bodies are seen throuphout the. lesions. in part A. at least four additional microfoci of papillary proliferations similar to the dominant. mass cell carcinoma are seen in the adjacent grossly normal renal parenchyma. In part F, a 1.2 cm. dominant papillary renal cell carcinoma is seen in association with three additional microfoci of papillary. prolierationsare seen in the adjacent renal parenchyma. In part C, a 0.8 cm dominant mass composed of nests of cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and. small round nuclei with prominant nucleoli is seen in association with two microfoci of papillary neoplasia. While the the minute papillary proliferations fall short of the size criterion for the diagnosis of papillary. renal cell carcinoma (they are < 5 mm in diameter) their histolgic resemblence to the definitive foci of. papillary renal cell carcinoma and the finding of multifocal papillary renal cell carcinoma suggest that these. small lesions may have more in common with papillary carcinoma than with isolated small tumors of the. type that are called adenomas. In part F, the renal capsule adjacent to the dominant tumor is disrupted, however, it is not clear that this is. tumor capsular penetration as oppsed to artifact associated with specimen handling and transport. Select slides were shown at the departmental. and the faculty in attendance. concurred with the above diagnoses.

The patient is a. lyear-old man with a left renal mass. He undergoes partial nephrectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in formalin in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record. number. Part A is additionally labeled ""anterior mass left kidney."" It consists of a single fragment of brown renal. tissue, notable for a single nodular mass protruding from the capsular surface. The specimen measures. 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. The mass measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and protrudes above the capsular surface 1.1 cm. The surface of the mass is partially covered by a thin, translucent membrane, which is partially retracted. The specimen is unoriented. The kidney resection margin is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially. sectioned, revealing a hemorrhagic, partially cystic mass that appears to infiltrate the renal cortex. The. mass approaches to within 1 mm of the black-inked margin. The specimen is entirely submitted in. cassettes A1 through A7. Part B is additionally labeled ""Gerota's, ink marks area adjacent to mass, suture marks external margin."" It. consists of an irregular fragment of lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 7.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Opposing sides of the roughly flat tissue fragment are partially epithelialized; one side is inked with purple. ink, and the other is marked with a black suture. These represent the sides adjacent to the tumor and. external surface, respectively. The inked surface is notable for focal areas of fibrous nodularity. The. sutured surface is glistening, smooth, and unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: inked surface. is re-inked with blue ink, and the sutured surface is inked with black ink. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: Cassettes B1-B2: Region of slight nodularity in the area of heaviest initial surgical inking. Part C is additionally labeled ""peri-mass fat renal tumor."" It consists of a single discoid fragment of. lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm. One surface is notable for a roughly. circular fragment of fibrous membrane, measuring 3.0 x 2.5 cm. The surface of the membranous structure. is smooth, glistening, and without lesions. The membrane area is inked with black ink. The specimen is. serially sectioned, revealing unremarkable lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue. A representative section is. submitted in cassette C1. Part D is additionally labeled ""left kidney mass #2."" It consists of a single roughly spherical fragment of. tan-brown, soft tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The tissue consists of a fragment of renal tissue and. capsule surrounding a variegated tan and red-brown mass that projects above the renal surface a distance. of 0.6 cm. The specimen is not oriented. The surgical margin is inked entirely with black ink. The. specimen is serially sectioned, revealing a punctate, cystic, hemorrhagic cut surface with focal areas of. bright-yellow material located peripherally. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes D1 through D3. Part E is additionally labeled ""prerenal fat."" It consists of a single irregular fragment of lobulated, yellow fat. and associated gray-white, fibrous membrane as well as some adherent red-brown material, suspicious for. clot. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. Part F is additionally labeled ""left kidney tumor mass #3."" It consists of three fragments of tissue. The. largest fragment is tan/red-brown renal parenchyma, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. A portion of renal. surface with disrupted capsule is present and is notable for a single somewhat dome-shaped lesion,. measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm and projecting approximately 0.3 cm above the renal surface. The lesion is. variegated red-brown and yellow. The surgical margin is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially. sectioned, revealing a somewhat granular, tan-yellow lesion that irregularly infiltrates the subjacent renal. cortex. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes F1 through F3. The additional two tissue. fragments are red-brown and tan, unoriented, irregular tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The tissue appears to represent fibrous tissue as well as blood clot. This tissue is entirely submitted. in. cassette F4. Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E18. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 40%. Fish Ordered: Yes on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and nn longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTes (TM) test Lis. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified External kit-slides proviaed by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: -year-old female with abnormal mammogram. The right breast upper outer quadrant 2.5-cm Mass appeared. biopsy invasive lobular carcinoma. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: E - right breast wide local excision needle localization: Tumor is 1.7 cm located 1.3 cm from the nearest/lateral. margin called by Dr to Dr. at. ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above. reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen. and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. E18. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside. NA. Tissue source breast. Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. ONCOTYPE DX BREAST CANCER ASSAY. RESULTS: Recurrence Score: 9.

These are sections of lymph node characterized by. moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of. involvement by tumor. C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor. (slides 5 and 6 ), composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding. pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli,. associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described. mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed, but non-encapsulated, nodular mass,. composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped. nuclei, arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin. with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The. grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the. subpleural alveolar architecture, associated with irregular fibrous thickening. of the pleura, which is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes and plasma cells, forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters. of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli, most notably. within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is. identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated,. pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The. vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph. node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no. morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. D. One slide is examined, including the entirely submitted specimen. These. are sections of a biopsy portion of lung, composed of benign alveolar. parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue, consistent with parietal. pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is. identified. E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing. fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally. present within the clot, occasionally forming gland-like structures. No lymph. node is identified within the entirely submitted specimen. SPECIAL STAINS: A. section of tumor (block A1) is stained by the immunoperoxidase method for. thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). The tumor cells reveal weak to. moderate intranuclear positivity, consistent with lung primary. A section of. block E is also stained for TTF -1.

DIAGNOSIS: ""Adenocarcinoma (reported to Dr. positive. patient ID)"" by Dr. Pre-Op Diagnosis. Lung mass. Post-Op Diagnosis. Same as above. Clinical History. Nothing indicated. Gross Description: Five parts. Container labeled. right lung lower lobe wedge"". has a previously partially sectioned wedge-shaped portion of. recognizable pulmonary parenchyma having intact staple lines as the. margin of resection. The specimen as received weighs 8.5 grams and. measures 6.0 x 4.5 x 1.6 cm. The pleura is slightly wrinkled and. gray-tan to brown. Eccentrically noted is a 2.2x2.2 cm area of. induration and slight umbilication of the pleura. Sectioning beneath. this reveals a poorly defined eccentric 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm nodular. lesion with a gritty gray-tan fibrotic cut surface. This grossly. extends up to the pleura but not through it. In addition, this. extends to within 0.1 cm of the nearest staple line margin; however,. this does not grossly appear to be transected at the staple line. margin.

Container labeled. level 7 lymph node"" has two. nodular portions of gray-tan fleshy tissue, 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and. 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single. cassette. Container labeled. - right lung lower lobe"" has a. 178 gram portion of recognizable pulmonary parenchyma grossly. consistent with right lower lobe. The specimen as received measures. 16.0 x 9.9 x 3.3 cm and has as its margin of resection the. bifurcation of the tertiary bronchi. Adjacent to the bronchus is a. 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm gray-black fleshy nodule. The nodule has a fleshy. mottled gray-black cut surface. The pleura is smooth to slightly. wrinkled mottled tan-brown with minimal anthracotic streaking. Noted. on the anterolateral aspect at the basal margin is a Y-shaped staple. line over an area of 5.2 cm. This is grossly consistent with a. staple line matching that of the wedge-shaped portion of pulmonary. parenchyma described in part one of this case. The staple line is. grossly intact. On sectioning in this region, the parenchyma is. hemorrhagic and spongy without gross lesions. This area is noted at. its nearest point 4.0 cm from the nearest bronchial margin. The. remaining parenchyma is spongy and tan-gray to pink with slight. congestion; however, no discrete gross lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted labeled as follows: A - shaved. bronchial margin and bisected peribronchial nodule; B-F - entire. shaved area of staple line parenchyma; G - remaining uninvolved. parenchyma.

Microscopic Description: The stides labeled. are examined. See diagnosis. Final Diagnosis. Right lung, lower lobe (wedge biopsy): Tumor characteristics: Procedure: Wedge biopsy. Specimen integrity: Intact. Specimen laterality: Right. Specimen site: Right lower lobe. Tumor size: 2.3 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor focality: Unifocal. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with associated fibrosis (see. comment). Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Visceral pleural invasion: Carcinoma extends up to but not through. visceral pleura. Lymphovascular space invasion: Foci highly suspicious for. lymphovascular space invasion. identified. Surgical margin status: Carcinoma extends to within 1 mm of the staple line on this wedge. resection (see comment). Other: Emphysematous changes. Level 7 lymph node (biopsy): Reactive sinus histiocytosis, lymphoid hyperplasia and. anthracosilicosis, no metastatic. carcinoma identified within two lymph nodes (0/2). Right lung, lower lobe (lobectomy): Specimen integrity: Intact, prior wedge biopsy resection noted (see. comment). Specimen laterality: Right. Specimen site: Lower lobe. Tumor characteristics: No residual carcinoma identified within. lobectomy specimen, see. above diagnosis on wedge biopsy. Bronchial margin: No carcinoma identified. Three peribronchial lymph nodes demonstrating reactive sinus. histiocytosis, mild lymphoid. hyperplasia, and anthracosilicosis, no metastatic carcinoma. identified (0/3). Area of staple line, prior wedge biopsy, demonstrating recent. hemorrhage consistent with. surgery, no residual carcinoma identified. Emphysematous changes. Level 9 lymph node, right lung, specimen four (biopsy): Reactive sinus histiocytosis, lymphoid hyperplasia and. anthracosilicosis, no metastatic. carcinoma identified within one lymph node (0/1). Level 4 lymph node, right lung, specimen five (biopsy): Fragmented lymph nodes demonstrating reactive sinus histiocytosis,. lymphoid hyperplasia,. and anthracosilicosis, no metastatic carcinoma identified (see. comment). pTN stage: pT1b NO. Comments. This is staged as a pT1b NO carcinoma based on a size of 2.3 cm. in. greatest diameter and negative lymph nodes. The final stage should. be performed in conjunction with the clinical history. The carcinoma. is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of fibrosis. suggestive of a so-called scar carcinoma. Although the overall. histology is consistent with a lung primary, the possibility of. metastasis should be ruled out clinically. The carcinoma extends up. to but not into or through the visceral pleura. Clinical correlation. and follow up is recommended. The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. Specimen five was received fragmented and, therefore, an accurate. node count cannot be performed.

The specimen is totally. submitted for frozen diagnosis in I. C. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a specimen labeled ""right distal ureter #2"" consisting. of one segment of circular tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely. submitted for frozen diagnosis in F. D. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled ""urethral margin"" are multiple irregular. fragments of red-pink soft tissue aggregating to 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted. for frozen diagnosis in cassette. E. The specimen consists of a urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, prostate and attached seminal vesicles. and vas deferens. The bladder measures 12 x 10 x 6.3 cm. The external surface of the bladder is. covered by a smooth serosal lining at the dome, and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. This. surface is inked black. After the bladder is opened, an area of granular, erythematous mucosa is. identified in the trigone region extending around the right ureteral orifice and right bladder wall. This area. measures 2.8 X 2.3 cm. No discreet mass is identified on the mucosal surface of the bladder. Upon. sectioning, however, there is a mass extending from under the area of erythema around the right. ureteral orifice and down along the length of right ureter and into the fat. This mass is tan-white and. solid, however, the mid portion of the mass in the right ureter is largely necrotic. The mass measures. 4.5 x 3.8 x 2.7 cm in total. The mass appears to extend through the muscularis propria in the portion. that involves the bladder wall and into the adipose tissue. It is within 0.7 cm of the inked radial margin at. its closest point. The mass does not appear to grossly involve the margin of resection of the right ureter. The right ureter measures 7.2 cm in length. A segment of left ureter is present and measures 2.6 cm in. length. Upon opening, the mucosa of the left ureter appears unremarkable. The prostate measures 3.9. cm craniocaudally, 4 cm anteroposteriorly, and 5 cm transversely. The capsular surface is smooth and. appears to be intact. The gland is inked blue on the right, and yellow on the left, and sectioned from. apex to base transversely at 3 mm intervals perpendicular to the urethra. Cross sections do not a reveal. a mass lesion. Rubbery nodularity is not present. The seminal vesicles are grossly unremarkable.

E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain. However, focal tubular formation is. noted in scattered portions of tumor. Based on morphologic and. immunohistochemical features, the tumor type is interpreted as being. infiltrative lobular carcinoma with focal ductal differentiation. Assessment of the greatest dimension of tumor size is hindered by. the multifocal nature of the infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The greatest. dimension of 2.3 CM is based on the combination of microscopic and. radiographic findings in this case. PART C. The tumor exhibits features that are similar to those features seen in the. tumor in Part A. This case received intradepartmental consultation.

The morphologic features of the tumor are unusual. The tumor. exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by cells with a. variably eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with solid pattern. of growth, also with clear cell features, are present. Scattered. calcifications are seen. Within the solid areas, some tumor cells. exhibit spindling and atypia; however, no definitive sarcomatoid. de-differentiation is identified. Immunohistochemical stains for the tumor cells are positive for. cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal), racemase (p504s), vimentin and PAX-8. (focal) A stain for p63 is negative. The overall cytoarchitectural features and immunohistochemical. profile are compatible with a renal cell carcinoma; subtyping of the. tumor is difficult. The tumor predominantly exhibits features of a. papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2) Although focal areas are. suggestive of Xp11 translocation carcinoma, the immunohistochemical. profile (positivity for EMA and cytokeratin 7) do not support this. impression. This case will be sent to. for. expert consultation. Their findings and final diagnosis will be. reported in a supplemental report. Original Gross Description. A.

Received fresh in a container labeled ""right hemicolectomy"". is a segment of bowel consisting of 6 cm of terminal ileum. with contiguous 23 cm of proximal colon. The serosal surface is. glistening and tan-pink, and there is a moderate amount of attached. adipose tissue. There is an unremarkable appendix present,. measuring 6.5 cm long X 0. cm in diameter. On cut surface, it is. without focal lesion, without gross evidence of inflammation. The. bowel measures 3.6 cm and 8 cm in circumference at the proximal and. distal resection margins respectively. The bowel is opened, and. there is a circumscribed 5.3 X 5 cm rubbery white-pink mass located. 11 cm proximal to the distal margin. A portion of tumor and of. normal tissue are submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical. requested. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 1.6. cm, and grossly extends through the musuclaris propria and into. surrounding adipose tissue. It is 1 cm from the outer surface of. the specimen. The remainder of the bowel wall averages 0.5 cm thick. and has a tan-pink glistening mucosa with a normal pattern and. folds. The adipose tissue is dissected, and soft tan lymph nodes are. identified up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. RS-17, following. fixation. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - proximal and distal resection margins; 2-6 -. tumor, including relation to uninvolved tissue; 7 - ileocecal valve;. 8 - random colon; 9 - appendix; 10-12 - multiple lymph nodes per. block; 13-15 - one sect ed lymph node per block; 16,17 - sectioned. largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. The following template summaries the findings in this case: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma of the colon. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : Adenocarcinoma invades through the full. thickness of the bowel wall and into surrounding adipose tissue. (pT3). Proximal margin: Negative. Distal margin: Negative. Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative. Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description. Vascular invasion: Not identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : pN1c. Twenty-one negative lymph nodes. are identified and they are negative for malignancy.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. for patient ,. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 2D appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12S (c.34G>A) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION. Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #2 performed by."

Comment. The specimen is received in two parts. There is a polypoid lesion, which is made up of spindled. and epithelioid dyscohesive cells that show a high mitotic activity and pleomorphism, consistent. with high-grade spindle cell neoplasm. Foci within this polyp also show typical squamous cell. carcinoma. The second specimen is made up of a large area of squamous dysplasia with early. invasive conventional squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. The conventional. squamous cell carcinoma is seen within 0.3 cm of the lateral and deep margins. The sarcomatoid. carcinoma component is largely confined to the exophytic polyp and is not seen near the margins. The tumor thickness of the early invasive component is 0.3 cm, however the total thickness taking. into account the polypoid lesion is 1.5 cm. Clinical History. oral tongue cancer.

There is, however, no material identified in our files for review and comparison. Accordingly,. a limited series of immunohistochemical stains is performed on a representative block of a malignancy. Sections are examined along with appropriately. staining positive and negative controls, with the following results: CK7- Positive. CK20 Negative. TTF1- Positive. RCC- Negative. Histologically, the malignancy does not resemble a typical renal cell carcinoma, and the staining pattern above essentially excludes the possibility of a. metastasis from the kidney, and is typical of a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The malignancy grossly approaches the stapled parenchymal surgical margin to within less than 0.1 cm. Following removal of the staple line, the inked. margin in this site is involved by malignancy. It is noted, however, that the nature of the stapling procedure itself precludes sampling of the true. surgical margin. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Container A is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe,"" and contains a 16.0 x 8.5 x 2.8 cm, lung lobe. The pleura is purple-pink, moderately. anthracotic. and glistening. A 10.0 x 3.5 cm, area of exposed red-pink mucosa is present. Within this area are multiple exposed segments of bronchi and. vasculature. Extending from both ends of this area are two serpiginous staple lines, each measuring 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. The staple line is. removed. and. the underlying parenchyma is inked black. Additionally, the exposed bronchi and vascular margins are taken en face, and the exposed. parenchyma is also inked black. The bronchi feature yellow-tan, striated endothelium with no discrete lesions. Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 1.5. x. 1.5. cm,. well circumscribed, yellow-tan, firm glistening mass that resides 0.4 cm below the blue-inked pleura, and approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the. closest stapled parenchymal margin. The remainder of the cut surface is pink-tan and focally congested. No additional lesions are identified.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: TTF1, PAX-8, ERG. AFB, GMS, ELASTIC. ADDENDUM #1: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for. use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,. frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular. the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal. cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these. mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor. KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,. etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for the E746 A750del5 mutation in Exon 19. INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the. LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell. lung carcinoma. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. E746 A750dell5 corresponds to 2235 2249del15. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #2 performed by.

TCGA-AR-A1AM.10C43124-3C21-443C-8268-23BF8A4D317E,2,"; Final Diagnosis. Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Multiple (2) nodules of invasive mammary carcinoma are. identified. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 1/3,. mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9] is identified forming a mass (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm) located in. the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC pTlc]. This cancer shows HER2/neu protein. overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel. lymph node No. 1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible. by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision. below). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;. Nottingham score /9] is identified forming a second lesion (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) in the upper outer. quadrant located 0.6 cm inferior and medial to the first lobular carcinoma mass [AJCC pT1c]. This tumor also shows HER2/neu protein overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below). However, there is no morphologic evidence of metastasis by this second lesion into any of the. sentinel lymph nodes. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present within and outside the. invasive component with a separate nodule in the central/deep breast, 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, located. 1.4 cm medial to the infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Angiolymphatic invasion is not seen. The. non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes. are present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All. surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor. free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior/superior margin). Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 12) right axillary sentinel lymph. node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1 mi (sn)]. This positive sentinel node is. designated No. 1D (tissue block A4) and is characterized by a roughly 1.1 mm collection of. keratin positive tumor cells without much in the way of H&E morphologic correlation. As noted. above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary. sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (verified by keratin immunostaining). Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and. No. 4. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1B, No. 1C, No. 1D,. No. 2B, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C. HER2/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation. guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor. nodules (using tissue blocks B2 and B4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for. HER2/neu amplification will be performed and reported in an addendum. HER2 protein immunohistochemical (IHC) test results are only valid for non-decalcified paraffin. embedded specimens fixed in neutral buffered formalin or Bouin's fixatives. Testing is. performed using commercially available kit/reagents employing a polyclonal antibody and a. polymer-based detection system. ADDENDA: No amplification for HER2/neu is demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH,. performed in Laboratory Genetics) (blocks B2 and B4) according to the interpretation guidelines. in the FDA approved PathVysion Her2 DNA Probe Kit."

A well-circumscribed tumor (15.0 X 8,5 x 9.0 cm) is present occupying approximately 90% of the renal parenchyma. It is yellow tan. with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor appears to invade the renal sinus and renal vein, however, the renal vein. margin is free of tumor. The tumor does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat margin. The pelvis appears nodular but has a. smooth surface. The kidney parenchyma away from tumor shows multiple tumor nodules. One centimeter from the ureteral margin is. a 0.2 cm cystic nodule. The ureteral margin is grossly free of tumor. The renal hilum is expanded (15.0 X 6.0 x 6.0 cm) and contains multiple matted lymph nodes (approximate total of 23), most of. which are grossly involved by tumor. The adrenal gland appears uninvolved by tumor. INK CODE: Black - soft tissue margin.

TCGA-BQ-5888.f725dd99-eee0-4f0a-90ba-4aeef1e2fc4a,0,"Clinical Diagnosis & History: year old male with right renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right renal tumor (fs). 2: SP: Deep surgical margin, right kidney. 3: SP: Paracaval lymph node. DIAGNOSIS: 1. SP: Right renal tumor (fs): Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma - Unclassified type. High grade. See comment. Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 3.7 cm. This pertains to the largest tumor although multiple lesions are present. See comment. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Not Identified. Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified. Surgical Margins: Tumor present at renal parenchymal margin (for partial nephrectomy specimens only). See comment. Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Marked chronic inflammation and arteriolonephrosclerosis. Adrenal Gland: Not identified. Lymph Nodes: Not identified. Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT1 Tumor <= 7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney. COMMENT: The tumors in this case exhibit a very unusual constellation of features that do not fit into any of our well defined. categories. The main tumor mass is predominantly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas. It is high grade. Focal areas of. necrosis are evident. In the adjacent renal parenchyma there are innumerable neoplastic foci that have tubular features and. basophilic cytoplasm. These measure from 3 millimeters to less than 0.1 millimeter. It is these foci of disease that are present at. the parenchymal margin of resection. The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase. It is negative for. CA9. The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF-47 is not interpretable. The overall. appearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this. statement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case. Close examination of the contralateral kidney. is advised. Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of. Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration The FDA has determined that such clearance or. approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This. laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. as qualified to perform high complexity clinical. laboratory testing. 2.

CLINICAL HISTORY: None provided. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. ADDENDUM: The positive margin in this case (slide A6) was reviewed with Dr. and correlated with the gross. examination and operative report. During the operative procedure there was a surgical violation of the. prostatic capsule in two places that were marked by surgical sutures for gross examination. One of. these areas was at the site of the positive margin and comparing this information to the histological. section it is likely that inked drained through this surgically created cleft. In summary, it is likely that the. tumor present at the inked surface in this slide is not a true positive margin."

The renal artery and vein at the margin are grossly unremarkable. The 5.5 cm long. ureter is unremarkable at the margin. 4.5 cm from the margin of resection the lumen is partially. obstructed by a bulging 1.5 x 1.0 cm tumor nodule extending from a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm lobulated fleshy. gray mass located in the lower pole. This mass is grossly confined within the renal capsule but invades. the renal collecting system. No extension into the scant amount of perinephric fat is identified. There is. a well delineation of pale kidney tissue surrounded by viable kidney tissue in the upper pole adjacent to. the mass. There are two additional simple cysts, one in the upper pole, one in the lower pole up to 0.9. cm. The surrounding kidney tissue is unremarkable. No enlarged lymph nodes are identified. Microscopic Description: Procedure type: Radial nephrectomy. Histologic grade (Fuhrman): Grade 4 (with other areas of grade 3). Sarcomatoid features: Present (approximately 10%). Tumor size: 5.5 cm. Extent: Directly invades renal sinus fat and renal pelvis. Adrenal Gland: Not present in specimen. Angiolymphatic invasion: Absent. Margins: All margins free of tumor. Lymph nodes: None present. Pathologic stage: pT3 NX MX. Non-neoplastic kidney: Multiple cysts with focal calcification. Patchy scarring and chronic pyelonephritis,. likely related to tumor effect. Diagnosis Details: Comments: Tumor morphology is unusual and does not fit typical classification schemes. Some areas. have papillary growth, others are more solid and infiltrative with irregular, infiltrative borders into the. renal parenchyma. Numerous areas are solid with large epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm. Tumor. invades the collecting system which has been associated with more aggressive neoplasm. Some features raise the possibilty of a translocation-associated carcinoma or possibly a hereditary. syndrome-type carcinoma. Immunostains for cytokeratin 1, P504, pancytokeratin, CD10, p63, and PAX-8 were performed. The. tumor cells are positive for PAX-8 and P504. Pancytokeratin stains portions of the tumor strongly (the. papillary areas) but is negative in other areas. CK7 and CD10 are negative. p63 is negative. This. immunostaining pattern is not specific and does not clarify the differential diagnosis further, other than. to confirm that is is a renal cell carcinoma. ADDENDUM REPORT. The consultant opinion is that this tumor is best classified as a papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2),. with foci of sarcomatoid and rhaboid change. However, a renal cell carcinoma related to hereditary. leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome (HLRCC) cannot be excluded. To exclude this, clinical. evaluation for cutaneous leiomyomas and genetic testing (can be performed on peripheral blood) for. mutations of the fumarate hydratas gene are suggested.

Fish Ordered: Yes on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis. was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. 1 using rabbit anti-. human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP. and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used. A9. Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA. Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes. HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® theranv is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

Regional Lymph Nodes: Total number with metastasis: 1. Total number examined: 19. Additional pathologic findings: Focal abscess formation adjacent to tumor. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 pN1a. Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending. clinical review and additional information. Comment: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes without carcinoma were identified. These lymph nodes contained numerous follicles that appeared. reactive. However, due to the large size of the lymph nodes, the number of follicles, and the patient's age, immunostains for BCL2,. CD3 and CD20 were performed to exclude follicular or another low grade lymphoma. These stains reveal a benign reactive pattern. with no evidence of lymphoma. Clinical History: cecal cancer. Gross Description: Specimen fixation: formalin. Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon with attached fat. Specimen length: The terminal ileum is 4.5 cm in length and the large bowel is 12 cm in length. Orientation: The cecal pouch where the tumor is inked blue.

The carcinoma has grown centrally as ar as the main bronchus and in peripheral regions shows areas of slight. invasion of the hypocellular fibrosed visceral pleura. It is therefore not possible to decide whether the. carcinoma has arisen in the periphery of the lung or in the center of the bronchial pathway. The lymph node. metastases, like the isolated invasions of small vessels, lie wthin the tumor or the bronchopulmonaary region. Apart from the main tumor, which has penetrated focally across the transverse pleural fissure into the adjacent. section of middle lobe, a separate small tumor focus has been detected in the middle lobe. This is classified as a. satellite nodule in another lobe, although histologically it hardly shows a squamous epithelial differentiation and. contains a small light-cell solid component. A tumor-associated high-grade inflammation is also found here. The etiology of the interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which shows only minimal process activity, is histologically. unclear: there may be an association with respiratory bronchiolitis."

Gross Description: Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section and is a 10 x 4 x 3 cm red/tan soft tissue fragment which. was frozen as FSA1. Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled ""liver segments 5, 8, stitch = do not mark. margin upper section"" and is a 740 gram, 15.5 x 14.8 x 10.5 cm partial hepatectomy specimen. There is one. roughened cauterized surface, which is the surgical resection surface. This surface is entirely. inked blue. At the periphery, there is a 9.3 x 4.0 cm area of exposed golden brown liver parenchyma. There. is a portion of the liver tacked down to this surface with suture materia. There is additionally suture. material in the center of this exposed parenchyma. This is believed to be the surface referenced on the. specimen container as ""do not mark margin upper section"". The capsular surface is red/tan, subtly mottled with hemorrhage and remarkable for a 10 x 7.5 cm area of. subcapsular firmness. This does not appear to be a contiguous mass. Sectioning exhibits golden brown liver. parenchyma. The liver parenchyma is remarkable for at least three intraparenchymal lesions, 8 x 5 x 3. mm, 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm, and approximately 11 x 7 x 6.5 cm. These intraparenchymal lesions are each firm,. white and have well-defined to scalloped borders. The largest lesion has some areas of erythema and. hemorrhage scattered throughout. The largest lesion causes the capsular disruption noted previously. The largest lesion has a lobulated shape and is believed to cause all of the capsular distortions. The two. smaller lesions are well within the parenchyma and not near the capsule. The smallest lesion is 4.3 cm to. the closest blue inked margin, the mid sized lesion is 4.8 cm to the closest blue inked margin and the largest. lesion is 2.1 cm to the closest blue inked margin. There are no other abnormalities readily identified within. the liver parenchyma. There is a wire mesh stent present within some of the vasculature of the liver.

The specimen measures 15 X 11 X 3 cm. (lesser curve length - 8.5 cm; greater curve length - 19 cm) . The distal margin is inked blue and taken entirely en face in. block FSA1. The proximal margin closest to the tumor is taken en. face in FSA2 (yellow ink where sampled). The tumor is a 9.3 X 6 cm protruding mass centered on the lesser. curvature occupying approximately 75% of the stomach. circumference. It is located 3.2 cm from the proximal gastric. margin (as measured at the time of frozen section in the fresh. specimen) and 5.7 cm from the duodenal margin. The subserosal. fibroadipose tissue is indurated and fixed to the tumor. On cut. section the tumor is solid white/tan and invades through the. muscularis propria into the lesser omentum fat. Where not. covered with fat, the serosal surface is smooth without areas of. retraction or puckering, and grossly does not appear to be. involved (inked green). Tumor surface has a shallow ulceration,. and tumor thickness ranges 1.2 to 1.6 cm. Approximately 40% of. the tumor circumference has a rolled, heaped up mucosal border. that is next to the ulceration. The rest of the tumor is. polypoid without a rolled border, with a well-circumscribed. invasive front along the peripheral edge (consistent with. Borrmann mixed type 1 and 2).

In the left mastectomy specimen, there is extensive DCIS which is associated with both foci of invasive carcinoma. The DCIS. involves. an area of breast tissue which is estimated to measure 7 to 8 cm. The two foci of invasive carcinoma are separated by. approximately 2.0 cm of breast tissue which has foci of DCIS. There is a morphologic spectrum of DCIS ranging from low grade. to high grade with necrosis. Both invasive carcinomas have an associated prominent lymphocytic response. The nuclear grade. of the invasive carcinoma ranges from intermediate to high grade. The additional submitted margins and final margin status were discussed with Dr. The additional submitted margins. (specimens D-F) appear to cover the superficial aspect of both tumors. Specimen D has skin and breast tissue and the true surgical resection margins (superior/lateral aspect of the specimen) are. negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. There are some glands at the deep aspect of this specimen which are most likely. benign but are difficult to interpret due to cautery artifact. This area does not correspond to true surgical margin. Specimen F has skin and breast tissue, and the true surgical resection margins (inferior/lateral aspect of the specimen) are. negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. In this specimen, there is a small focus of a cauterized atypical ductal proliferation. present at the superior edge of the specimen which does not represent true margin in this specimen. The differential diagnosis. includes a small focus of residual DCIS, atypical ductal hyperplasia or secretory change with cytologic atypia. GROSS DESCRIPTION.

The patient is a. with a history of prostate cancer, Gleason grade 5+4 (9), who undergoes. radical retropubic, nerve-sparing prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections. Gross Description. The specimen is received fresh in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Part A, additionally labeled ""right pelvic lymph nodes,"" consists of multiple aggregates of soft, red-yellow,. fibrofatty tissue measuring 7 x 3 x 1 cm in greatest dimension. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Cassette A1: Right lymph node, bisected. Cassette A2: One lymph node candidate. Cassette A3: Multiple lymph node candidates. Part B, additionally labeled ""left pelvic nodes,"" consists of multiple aggregates of soft, red-yellow, fibrofatty. tissue measuring in maximum dimension 6 x 3 x 0.8 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Cassette B1: Multiple lymph node candidates. Cassette B2: One lymph node candidate. Part C (FS1), labeled ""prostate and seminal vesicles (FS),"" consists of a large, intact prostate gland with. attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles weighing 55.1 gm. The gland measures, in maximum. dimension, 4 cm from apex to base, 4.7 cm from medial to lateral and 3.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The exterior of the gland is rough and red-tan, with numerous sutures along the anterior midline, closing. the dorsal vein complex. Sutures are also noted at the left posterior bladder margin, designating the site. requested for frozen section. Firm, white-tan, ovoid calculi are noted bilaterally along the lateral aspect of. the prostate, just underlying the most exterior fascia. The largest of the calculi measures 0.7 cm in. greatest dimension. There are numerous firm, palpable nodules within the prostate noted bilaterally. The. right anterior surface of the giand is inked in green, the left anterior surface is inked in blue, and the. posterior surface is inked in black. A shave biopsy is taken from the left posterior bladder margin,. bread-loafed, and submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1. Following frozen section, the apical and. remaining bladder margins are removed and fixed separately, and the remainder of the gland is serially. sectioned from apex to base perpendicular to the urethral channel into five serial slices. The serial slices. reveal a large, tan to bright white, firm, solid, lobulated lesion dominating the left lobe and crossing over. into the right lobe along the anterior aspect. This lesion essentially replaces most of the central and. transitional zones in all five serial slices. A small aspect of relatively normal-appearing tissue is noted in. the right posterior quadrant of serial slices 1-4. This area is composed of much softer, semi-porous, light. tan tissue. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for pathologic evaluation, all of the. remnant fresh prostatic tissue is taken for tissue banking/research purposes.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas. At the ampullary reglon, there is a nodular thickening lying beneath the. mucosa, measuring approximately 1.8 X 1,0 X 1.0 cm. Part of the common bile duct can be identified, but the exact orifice. is not clearly evident. Transverse sectioning of the head of pancreas reveals a firm craggy area beneath the area of. duodenal ulceration, this tumorous zone is ill-defined, but measures approximately 2.5 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. It appears. to. extend. close to the uncinate margin and possibly extend into peripancreatic tissue in the upper pancreaticoduodenal area. The. ulcerated duodenal wall is obscured. Further sectioning reveals small firm lymph nodes in the vicinity of the common bile duct, the superior margin, and the. pancreas as well as in the pancreatoduodenal region. Sections are taken as follows: D1. Pancreatic neck margin. D2,D3. Two halves of the superior transverse section of pancreas. D4,D5. Two halves of next transverse section of pancreas. D6,D7. Two halves of transverse sections through mid zone of pancreas including uncinate. margin. D8. Additional sections of uncinate margin. D9,D10.

Perpendicular section of pyloric valve margin closest to area of ulceration in the proximal. duodenum. E. The specimen consists of a firm fragment of oval tissue, measuring 1.6 X 1.2 X 0.6 cm. The tissue has a homogeneous. cut surface. The specimen is sectioned into three fragments and Is submitted entirely in two cassettes. Collected Date: Received Date/Time: Frozen Section Diagnosis. FSB. Bile Duct Margin: Negative for malignancy. FSC. Pancreatlc Margin: Negative for malignancy. Microscopic Description. A. The gallbladder shows chronic inflammation with mild irregularity of mucosal architecture. No cytologic atypia Is. present. B. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Only a small segment of bile duct tissue is. present. The surface epithelium is partly denuded but residual epithellum shows no significant atypla and there is no. malignancy in this fragment. C. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. D. There is a widespread invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that shows a varied morphology, ranging from well-. defined angulated ductal structures through to areas where more solid sheets and small nodules and single cells with. prominent nuclear pleomorphism can be seen. The carcinoma erodes the common bile duct and focal areas on ductal. dyplasia are evident. Carcinoma is present in practically all of the sections taken. The extent of carcinoma thus exceeds. the extent of gross induration and It is estimated to have a size of at least 6,0 cm. Furthermore, carcinoma shows. extension beyond the pancreas Into peripancreatic tissue predominantly at the superior margin of the pancreas and in the. zone. between pancreas and duodenum. Carcinoma also invades into and through muscularis propria of the duodenum. and ulcerates the overlying duodenal mucosa, Carcinoma also focally involves the uncinate margin, and there are areas. where carcinoma encroaches on the cauterized soft tissue margin at the superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal. area. There is prominent perineural invasion, and the section taken of the proximal common bile duct margin includes. carcinoma with perineural growth at this resection odge. There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in areas, and there is metastatic carcinoma in four of eleven lymph nodes. The proximal gastric and distal duodenal margins are unremarkable. The sections of the ampulla of Vater show. prominence of periductal glands and smooth muscle but no cytologic atypia or tumor. ACB: Collected Date: Received Date/Time: E. Sections show lymph node tissue with no evidence of metastatic disease."

Space-occupying lesion of unclear pathogenesis left upper lobe, with pleural contact. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1.) Inflated, fixed upper lobe of left lung measuring 24 x 14 x 7 cm, central bronchus resection plane located 0.8. cm proximal to the birfurcation of the lingular bronchus. A 4.5 cm long staple suture line runs in a dorsocaudal. direction from the hilus. At the hilus are four lesioned grayish-black nodes between 0.8 and 1.4 cm. Lateral. pleural over segment 2 shows an unclearly demarcated 3 cm area of whitish discoloration characterized by a. depression-like retraction, under which is a moderately solid, predominantly pale brownish and partly patchy. grayish-black tumor, max. 5.5 cm in size, with a relatively clear and somewhat arcuate demarcation, extending. to the pleura in the region of the retraction. Truncation or opening of peripheral branches of B2, B1 and B3 in. the tumor. Lateral pleural region at the junction of S3/S4 shows an unclearly demarcated 0,4 cm area of. induration. Rest of parenchyma shows rarefaction in apical region of segment 1 with lacunae or lacuna systems. up to 0.6 cm in size, otherwise inconspicuous. 2.) Parietal pleura: membranous tissue measuring 10,5 x 8.5 cm and up to 0.1 cm thick with partly smooth,. partly rough surface,. 3) Interlobar LN (item 11) left: three lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.3 and 1.1 cm in size. 4) Hilar LN (item 10) left: two lesioned grayish-black nodes or node parts, 0.4 and 1.3 cm in size, partly with. some surrounding tissue. 5) Subcarinal LN (item 7): 1 cm lesioned grayish-black node or node part. 6) Paraaortic LN (item 6) left: combined 1.5 cm quantity of party grayish-red, partly blackish specimens. between 0.1 and 0.8 cm. 7) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (item 5) left: 2 cm lesioned grayish-black nodes with some. surrounding tissue. 8.) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) left: 2.2 cm lesioned grayish-brown node with some surrounding tissue. Examined: 1.) 2 sections of tumor with remaining parenchyma, 3 sections with pleura, indurated area (halved), 2 sections. of apical S1, central bronchus resection plane, resection margins of vessels, hilar nodes,. 2.) All material (lamellated),. 3.) - 8.) All material (in 7. + 8. preparations lamellated),. 15 blocks, partly Elastica-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS. Microscopy. Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Intermediate to peripheral manifest bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, partly. gigantocellular and polymorphocellular squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe of the left lung. TNM. classification according to this picture pT2 pNO V1 R0, stage IB. C 34.1; M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Small tumor necroses and tumor-related inflammation. Active, partly resorptive inflammation of the lung. parenchyma surrounding the tumor with inclusion of numerous macrophages. Circumscribed subpleural. alveolar and interstitial organizing and remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with inclusion of immature or. atypical squamous cell metaplasia also involving the bronchioles (S3 /4). Apical emphysematous stromal. remodeling with formation of small subpleural cysts. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and moderately marked deposits in the lymph nodes. Chronic parietal pleuritis with fibrosis. of. varying degrees (sample 2.)). Remark/addendum: This is probably a primarily peripheral carcinoma of the lung which, after central growth, has infiltrated. intermediate or subsegmental bronchi of segments 1 - 3 there, because there is tumor invasion of the overlying. visceral pleura, where there is also marked fibrosis. The main tumor mass is located in segment 2. The fibrosing. lesion of the lung parenchyma in the boundary region of segments S3/4, which includes atypical squamous cell. nests, could be the initial stage of a second bronchopulmonary carcinoma focus, because the histological picture. is not typical of a satellite nodule. But ultimately, the differential diagnosis of an atypical squamous cell. metaplasia in the context of a circumscribed fibrosing process initiated by inflammation cannot be made with. a. sufficient degree of reliability."

To assess distance to pancreatic. neck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and. sections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical. margin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section) . The. mass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and. the margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts. peripancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach. margin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5. cm. A number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the. peripancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,. submitted per block summary. Tumor was collected by Tissue. Block Summary : G1 - common bile duct margin, en face. G2 - pancreatic neck margin, en face. G3 - gastric mucosal margin, en face. G4 - duodenal mucosal margin, en face.

G13 - tumor in relation to the common bile duct, two sections. G14 - tumor undermining duodenal wall. G15 - pylorus, representative section. G16 - representative sections of stomach and duodenum. G17 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates. G18 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates at base of. common bile duct. G19 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates. G20-G22 - multiple perigastric lymph nodes candidates, each. cassette, greater omentum. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by. The frozen. section diagnoses are confirmed. Permanent sections show invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with mucinous. features within pancreatic head, extending into peripancreatic fat,. extending through the duodenal wall to undermine the mucosa, and. extending posteriorly to the pancreatic posterior soft tissue margin. at the site of the SMA and the portal vein. Definite nodal metastasis. is identified in block G18. Two soft tissue nodules in block G17 are. interpreted as most consistent with complete effacement by metastatic. carcinoma."

Specimen submitted: A. Distinguish between ureter or vein - FS; B. Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries, bladder. DIAGNOSIS: A. Soft tissue (excision): High-grade urothelial carcinoma, present within adventitia of vein. B. Bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries (resection): High-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with striking discohesive growth pattern, (7.0 cm). Immunohistochemistry performed at. demonstrates the following staining profile in. tumor. cells: Positive - CK7, CK903, mCEA. Negative - CK20, p63, p53, ER, E-Cadherin. Mucicarmine stain highlights presence of mucin within intracytoplasmic vacuoles. The carcinoma diffusely infiltrates the full thickness of the bladder, extending into the perivesical fat,. endomyometrium and cervix, extending to bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes. Tumor is present at the anterior and posterior surgical resection margins of bladder, and at the. fibromuscular tissue at bilateral ureteral sites. The urethral margin is negative for tumor. margin KD03 carcinoma, wothelial, NOS. Extensive lymphovascular invasion is present. TNM Pathologic tumor stage: pT4a pNX. Note: The tumor is composed of poorly differentiated rather small cells with discohesive growth pattern, intracytoplasmic. lumina and increased mitoses. This morphology mimicks that of lobular carcinoma of the breast, and the growth. pattern is similar to that seen in poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach, diffuse-type. The immunoprofile supports the urothelial origin in this case. In addition, conventional high-grade papillary urothelial. carcinoma was identified in the TURB specimen. lo residual typical urothelial cell carcinoma was. identified in sections of the current specimen. Given the growth pattern of this tumor, its presence in the ovaries and fallopian tubes is interpreted as local spread. from primary site, rather than metastatic disease. Urothelial carcinoma with discohesive growth pattern mimicking lobular carcinoma of breast have been previously. reported. Reference: Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder mimicking lobular carcinoma of the. breast: a discohesive variant of urothelial carcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Date - Date of Service: Contributor System: DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma-in-situ with pagetoid spread was noted in the patient' S bladder, urethra, and also in the cervical. specimen. In order to determine the origin of these processes, and whether or not they were related or separate,. we performed immunohistochemical studies on the bladder tumor (slide E7), the cervix (slide E17), and the. urethra (slide S2). The studies demonstrate the following: E7. E17. S2. Bladder. Cervix. Urethra. CK7. ++. ++. ++. +/- squamous mucosa. CK20. +. +. - squamous mucosa. CPV. High background. High background. High background. These results indicate that the carcinoma in situ process is related, and of transitional cell origin.

Reason For Referral. r/o HER2 gene amplification. Fixative. Formalin. Method: FISH using probes for HER2 (17q12) and a chromosome 17 centromere (D17Z1) control probe. (PathVysion,. Two technologists score signals in 60 total nuclei from invasive or. metastatic tumor and concurrent controls. nuc ish (D17Z1x2, Her2x3-5). The HER2 to D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. Interpretation: The invasive tumor nuclei have an amplified HER2D17Z1 ratio (per ASCO/CAP. The HER2D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. In our opinion, this result may not. guidelines). reflect centromere true HER2 and amplification. 3-5 copies of Most the HER2 nuclei gene. have 2 This copies result of the indicates chromosome the. 17 tumor has. additional copies of the HER2 gene (i.e., duplication), but does not have sufficient. copies to suggest high level HER2 amplification. It is not known if HER2. duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Arch Path Lab Med 131:18-43, 2007). A HER2D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene amplification. A HER2D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene amplification.

Associated with the tumor is a low grade neuroendocrine component. composed of large nests, cords and single file cells with round nuclei and speckled chromatin. This. component is confined within the pancreas and no increased mitotic activity is present. Immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine markers CD56, chromogranin and synaptophysin performed on. block A10 highlights the neuroendocrine component. The neuroendocrine component and ductal. adenocarcinoma are both highlighted by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin 7. A total of seven lymph nodes are identified, of which three are positive for malignancy. One lymph node. metastasis is highlighted by immunohistochemistry for OSCAR-cytokeratin (block A8). Additional findings include extensive chronic pancreatitis with variable ductal dilatation and. intraepithelial neoplasia which ranges from low-grade to high grade (PanIN III). Adjacent benign. mesothelial cysts are present. There is mild gastritis but the stomach is otherwise unremarkable. The. gallbladder has mild chronic cholecystitis with foamy histiocytes in the mucosa. Within the pancreas, there. is a focus with dense eosinophilic change.

The cauterized parenchymal. margin measures 13.0 x 6.2 cm. There is a large obvious gross tumor. mass opposite to that margin. A double suture is present at one. aspect and a frozen section of that area is requested. The. parenchymal margin is inked black; a fleshy yellow to tan nodular. irregular area consisting of tumor mass which measures 9.0 x 12.0 x. 6.0 cm. Abutting this mass are other irregular tumor nodules which. measure a combined 3 cm. in greatest dimension. Separate from the. largest mass is a 2 cm. nodule which is present directly at the. suture which was requested for frozen section. A representative. section of that margin with attached tissue is submitted for frozen. section as frozen section AFS-1. Representative sections of tumor. and normal are submitted for tissue procurement. Representative. sections are submitted in 10 blocks as labeled.

Received fresh labeled ""additional lobe of liver"" is a. 670 gram, 14.0 X 4.0 x 4.5 cm. hepatectomy specimen with a. double long suture oriented as superior and a single long stitch. oriented as anterior which is hepatic capsular surface. The double. long stitch margin is inked black and the inferior side is inked red. for orientation. That inferior side represents the tissue adjacent. to specimen A. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal pale. tannish areas adjacent to the prior resection which may represent. residual tumor. The area adjacent to the single long stitch. designated anterior is inked orange. The superior margin is sampled. in frozen sections 1 and 2 and the area adjacent to the stitch. defined as anterior margin which appeared more capsular is submitted. as representative frozen section AFS3. Representative sections. after fixation. RS8. Representative sections are submitted for. frozen section with blocks BFS1 and BFS2 representing the new. superior margin and BFS3 representing the ""single stitch anterior. margin"" which appears to be hepatic capsule.

Microscopic examination of the right lobe of liver partial. hepatectomy: Histologic type: Hepatocellular carcinoma with solid, trabecular and. clear cell patterns. Histologic grade: Grade 3 of 4. Tumor size: The main tumor mass is 12 cm. in greatest dimension and. abutting additional irregular tumor nodules measuring a combined 3. cm. Primary tumor (pT) : Multiple nodules with size greater than 12 cm. (pT3a). Margins of resection: Tumor was present at the original superior. resection margin of part A. The final resection margins of part B. are negative. Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified in block. A7 and A5. No large vessel invasion is identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : Not evaluated, pNx. Distant metastasis (pM) : Not evaluated, pMx. Other findings: Special stains and immunohistochemical stains were. evaluated on block A1. The tumor showed the expected loss of. reticulin staining that one sees in hepatocellular carcinoma. The. tumor showed the usual canalicular spotty staining with CEA. The. tumor cells were completely negative for CK7, CK20 and CK8. The. tumor cells were also negative for HepPar 1. Although HepPar 1 is usually positive in hepatocellular carcinoma,. higher grade tumors can be negative and that is the finding in this. case. The background hepatic parenchyma shows findings of steatohepatitis. with approximately 30-40% mixed micro- and macrosteatosis with. chronic inflammation in the portal areas and mild chronic. inflammation within the hepatic lobules. Overall, the findings are. those of moderate steatohepatitis. Stage I fibrosis is noted in the. background hepatic parenchyma. No iron accumulation is identified. No PAS positive diastase resistant alpha-1 antitripsin globules are. identified. Iron, PAS, PAS with diastase, reticulin and trichrome. stains were evaluated on a representative normal tissue block (A10). Dr. also reviewed selected slides and concurred with the. diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and grade 3 interpretation. Of note, no definitive additional tumor was identified in specimen. B. Cautery artifact was noted in the areas which were considered. grossly suspicious for some residual tumor, but no definitive. residual tumor was identified microscopicly, even though some. additional sections were evaluated. 4x2, 14x2, 15x3, 18x5, 20x5.

It is uncertain. whether tumor in the current specimen and tumor in the right upper lobe represent two independent primaries or a. metastases. If these two tumors represent an independent primaries then the current tumor would be staged as T3NO. If the tumor in the right upper lobe represents a metastasis of the tumor in the left upper lobe then the stage would be. T3 NO M1a. Clinical correlation is suggested."

The patient now undergoes right hepatic lobectomy. GROSS DESCRIPTIONS. One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It contains a portion of right lobe of liver. weighing 321.2 grams and measuring 6.5 x 13.2 x 6.2 cm. cm. A small portion of tissue at the medial. side was sent for tissue procurement. The surgical margin is black. There is a 7.2 cm. (lateral to medial),. 3.6 cm. (anterior to posterior), and a 5.2 cm. (superior to inferior) firm, well demarcated mass at the. lateral side of the specimen. The mass is tan/white with focal bile staining. Grossly, the mass approaches. the the capsule on the anterior, posterior, and inferior surfaces, however the capsule appears intact. The. mass is 1.5 cm. away from the surgical margin. There is also a 0.7 cm. well demarcated small nodule. adjacent at the medial site which is separate from the main mass. The remaining liver parenchyma is. unremarkable. The attached gallbladder has been previously opened. The gallbladder appears. unremarkable. No stones are identified. BLOCK SUMMARY. 1 - lesion with lateral capsule. 2 lesion. 3 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 4 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 5 lesion. 6 lesion. 7 - surgical margin, adjacent to the gallbladder. 8-10 - additional section with surgical margin. 11 - smaller nodular lesion. 12 - normal appearing liver. 13 - surgical margin of cystic duct. 14 - representative section of gallbladder and additional. cystic duct section. LIGHT MICROSCOPY. Light microscopic examination is performed. Sections reveal that both of the grossly identified masses are moderately differentiated hepatocellular 1. carcinoma. The tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor. closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space. invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic. liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct. proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are. suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal. lymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic. effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no. evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Small foci of macrovesicular steatosis are noted. DIAGNOSIS. LIVER, RIGHT LOBE, LOBECTOMY - MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED HEPATOCELLULAR. CARCINOMA, TWO FOCI (7.2 AND 0.7 CM.

Histologic sections from the 9.5 cm mass demonstrates a moderately. differentiated adenocarcinoma with a heterogenous appearance. In. areas, the cells are tall columnar with areas of necrosis. In other. areas prominent mucinous differentiation is seen with features. morphologically suggestive of bronchial alveolar type. A limited. panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed with working. controls and demonstrates the cells to be positive for TTF1 and CK7. and negative for CK20. These findings support the diagnosis of. primary lung malignancy. An elastin stain is performed with working controls and highlights. rare neoplastic cells extending into but not entirely through the. elastic layer; however, based on size this is best classified as a. pT3. A total of 22 lymph nodes are identified including all parts, six of. which contain metastatic carcinoma.

Date Complete: Addendum Diagnosis. Sections of the previously decalcified ribs and soft tissues (specimen E). demonstrate a focus of invasive carcinoma involving the posterior rib margin. (block E4). Date Complete: Results-Comments. At the request of Dr. a representative portion of this case was. sent to Molecular Pathology for KRAS mutation analysis. This addendum is. created to report those findings. Cerner accession number: Body site: Left lung, left upper lobe. Specimen type: Paraffin embedded tissue. Surgical Pathology Block number: No KRAS mutations were detected (Wild Type KRAS) at codon 12 of the. KRAS gene in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be. analyzed. INTERPRETATION: No KRAS mutations were identified at codon 12 of the KRAS gene. in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be analyzed. METHODIASSAY LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist before. processing. DNA is isolated and the exon 2 of the KRAS gene is amplified by PCR. PCR products are subjected to Shifted Termination Assay (STA-TrimGen) technology. to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13. STA products are analyzed by capillary. gel electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. This assay is validated for the. detection of mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. Mutations in other. codons of KRAS are not evaluated. False positive or negative results may occur. for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue. sample analyzed. Mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be. detected. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other. laboratory information findings for the most accurate interpretation."

Gross Description: The specimens are received in six formalin filled containers, all labeled with. the patient's name. Part A is additionally labeled ""right lung (for precision). "" The specimen. consists of a right lung with dimensions of 21 X 12 X 6.5 cm. The lung has a. weight of 400 grams. There are multiple stapled vascular structures present at. the hilum. Additionally, there are staple lines within the parenchyma that have. a total length of 13 cm. The surgical staple lines are removed and the. parenchymal margins are inked blue. The pleural surface of the specimen is. gray-purple to tan-white and generally smooth. The pleural surface has been. inked black overlying the area of the mass and a portion of the tissue sent for. precision diagnostic studies. The specimen is remarkable for a firm tan-white. fungating mass within the bronchus of the right upper lobe. Serial sectioning. reveals that the mass has overall dimensions of 6 X 5 x 4 cm. The cut surfaces. of the mass are firm, tan-white and heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and. hemorrhage. The mass appears to fill the majority of the right upper bronchus. and erode through the wall. It comes to within 0.1 cm of the pleural surface. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked parenchymal margin. The remaining. uninvolved lung is pink-tan to red-brown and spongy. The bronchial spaces are. filled with gray-green mucoid material. Multiple lymph nodes are present. adjacent to the hilar structures. These range in greatest dimension from 0.5 to. 1.3 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows: A1. vascular margin;. A2-3. mass in right upper bronchus;. A4. mass to nearest parenchymal margin;. A5-6 remaining parenchymal margin taken en face;. A7. mass to pleura;. A8-11 additional representative sections of mass;.

The urethral margin. is inked blue. The arterial margin (?) is taken en face and inked orange. The. mass is bisected along the possible ureter to reveal a yellow/white, lobulated,. slightly hemorrhagic solid mass (14.4 x 9.6 x 7.0 cm) occupying most of the. kidney. There is very little visible normal renal cortex and no distinct. cortical medullary junction. The mass extends to the urethral resection margin. and abuts the renal capsule but does appear to extend into the fat (there is. a. thin 0.8 cm rim of fat surrounding the kidney) . There is a cystic cavity (1.0. x. 1.0 x 0.9 cm) within the tumor. Six sections of the tumor are submitted to. Tumor Bank as T1-T6. Half of T1 is also sent for.

Resident Review by. Final Diagnosis by. ADDENDUM. RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY PARENCHYMA. RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: DIFFUSE INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS AND TUBULAR ATROPHY, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY. TO CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY AND POSSIBLY VENOUS OBSTRUCTION. (SEE NOTE). ARTERIAL AND HYALINE ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE (SEE NOTE). NOTE: Only minimal non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma was available for examination due. to the extensive replacement of nephrons by the neoplastic process. The sample. of non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma examined showed diffuse parenchymal. scarring and moderate vascular sclerosis, but only mild glomerulosclerosis. These changes are most likely the result of chronic ipsilateral collecting. system obstruction, with a possible contribution by venous obstruction from the. renal vein and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. If the collecting system and. vascular obstruction were only unilateral, only functional adaptive changes. (and not the extensive parenchymal scarring seen here) would be expected in the. contralateral kidney. Changes of diabetic glomerulosclerosis are not apparent. in this sample. A potential effect of this patient's remote organochlorine. exposure is not apparent in the tissue but is also unknown. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by Dr. Renal. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A11) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are eighty-one. glomeruli present, of which six (7.4%) are globally sclerosed. The remaining. glomeruli show hypoperfusion and only minimal and focal expansion of the. mesangial areas. There are only rare discernible craters and double contours. of the glomerular capillary wall basement membranes. Few distal tubules. contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. Tubules show a reduction in size but there. is only focal thickening of the basement membranes. Several tubules (block. A10) show microcystic changes resembling thyroidization of the cortical. parenchyma. The interstitium is diffusely expanded and appears markedly. fibrotic without prominent inflammatory activity. Over 90% of the cortical. parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries exhibit a. moderate degree of sclerosis with some foam cell accumulation. Arterioles show. moderate sclerosis with focal and segmental hyaline degeneration. Report Status. Type: Cytogenetics. KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[10]. METAPHASES COUNTED: 10. ANALYZED: 3. SCORED: 15. BANDING: GTG. INTERPRETATION: 5 of 15 metaphase cells were aneuploid, containing 118-126 chromosomes, but the. chromosome morphology in these cells was very poor, and detailed cytogenetic. analyses could not be performed. The remaining 10 metaphase cells were. normal. COMMENTS: Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the. standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400. bands or greater. INDICATION FOR TEST: RCC."

Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy. specimen measuring in its partially inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two. separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging in size from 10 to 12 mm in. diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart). Surrounding the two bronchi is a. bare area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line is seen radiating. from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm in length. Differential. inking is as follows, the bare area is inked black and the staple line is. removed and inked blue. The pleural surface is tan to grey with a diffuse area. of induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the. lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There is also scarring. over the apex measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the. lung shows a centrally based/peri-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm in greatest. dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface. (posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen. The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It lles. 10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6. mm in greatest dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It lies 2 mm from. the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the. bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal. intervening lung. The residual lung shows moderate to severe emphysema and an. area of pleurally based fibrosis adjacent to the induration over the. lingular/lateral surface. [1A, bronchial margin; 1B, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-D,. TS through tumour with 1C including closest bronchial margin and 1D showing. extension to pleura; 1E-F, RS of tumour abutting pleural surface; 1G, second. possible tumour within apical aspect of lobe; 1H, RS of normal intervening lung. between main tumour mass and smaller tumour; 11, peri-bronchial lymph nodes;. 1J, area of fibrosis over lateral/lingular pleura; 1K, RS of emphysema within. upper portion of lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled hilar lymph node left lung' and consists of over. ten fragments of what appears to be nodal tissue ranging in size from 2 mm to. the largest piece measuring 20 mm in greatest dimension. The fragments have. a. grey black cut surface. [BIT: 2A, largest plece bisected; 2B, multiple smaller. fragments]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections reveal a moderate and poorly differentiated squamous cell. carcinoma. The tumour abuts but does not invade visceral pleura. The tumour. is clear of the bronchial resection margin. Within the confines of the tumour. there is focal vascular and lymphatic invasion. No perineural permeation by. tumour is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. No tumour is identified within these nodes. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma. in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising. pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra-alveolar foamy. macrophages. Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule. there is a small non-necrotising granuloma. The separately described. macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No. tumour is identified within these areas. 2: Sections of lymph node tissue reveal reactive changes with prominent sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. Reactive follicular hyperplasia is also. noted. Rare tiny ill-defined non-necrotising granulomata are also seen. focally. There is no evidence of malignancy.

CPT: 88309, 88342 x4, 88313. Comments. Histologic sections from the neoplasm demonstrate a tumor composed. of moderately pleomorphic cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and. large pleomorphic nuclei. The cells are arranged in small clusters. as well as large sheets. Focal areas of necrosis are noted. To better characterize this neoplasm, a panel of immunohistochemical. and histochemical stains are performed with working controls. The. cells are variably positive for CK7 with large areas strongly and. diffusely positive; other areas demonstrate more variable. positivity. The cells are weakly positive for CD10. The cells are. negative for vimentin and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. Hale's colloidal. iron is weakly positive in the majority of the cells. The overall histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical. features of this neoplasm are most consistent with chromophobe renal. cell carcinoma. The differential diagnosis includes oncocytoma,. however, given the nuclear features (binuclear forms, abundant. resinoid nuclei) distinct cytoplasmic borders, strong CK7 staining,. and positive, though weakly positive, colloidal iron staining, this. neoplasm is best classified as a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Clinical correlation is recommended. At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have. been additionally reviewed by Dr. who concurs with the. diagnosis. This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been. cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The.

On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen posteriorly in the. infero medial quadrant 12mm, query involvement of the disc. Plane of section: vertical. Intraocular description: On opening, a solitary, dome shaped, pigmented tumour is. seen involving the optic disc. Cut surface of optic nerve is. dusky - ? infiltration with tumour. Tumour size. LBD 13mm, Height 6mm. MICROSCOPY. Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal. anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep. anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are. unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are moderately atrophic. There is mild hyalinisation of the ciliary processes. The. lens shows moderately advanced cataractous changes. printed: HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT. Lab No. Clinical Consultant & Location. Unit No. In the posterior segment, close to the optic nerve head, a. choroidal melanoma can be seen. This is dome-shaped with a. small accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina. overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes. Focally, at the apex of the tumour, there is retinal. invasion. The tumour is partially pigmented and consists predominantly. of spindle cells. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for. MelanA, CD117 and HSP-27 (score 3). The number of mitoses is approx. 2/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is not prominent, and. closed loops are not present in the tissue planes evaluated. Occasional ""vascular lakes"" can be observed; in these tumour. cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic. infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are. scattered throughout the tumour in a mild density.There is. no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild. atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of. tumour. FINAL DIAGNOSIS. Choroidal melanoma of spindle cell type. COMMENT. In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA. extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent. probe amplification (MLPA) These investigations were. performed in the. The kit P027 from. which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using. and the. quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA. reaction. printed: : HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT. Lab No. Clinical Consultant & Location. Unit No. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on. assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice. on. differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis. demonstrated: normal chromosome 1,. three borderline losses of chromosome 3,. gains of chromosome 6. and gains in chromosome 8.

Gross Description: The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen. which weighs 226 grams. The kidney measures 12 cm from superior to inferior, 8 cm from medial to. lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Thin. and delicate membranous tissue is present along the anterior surface and consistent with Gerota's fashion. It is inked black. At the hilum the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened. without gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney inferiorly is a 6.5 cm. segment of thin and delicate ureter which is 0.3 cm in diameter. The ureter is open and the urothelium is. smooth and tan-white. The central posterior surface of the kidney is covered by a thin layer of fatty and. smooth membranous tissue with a palpable mass bulging outward from the posterior surface. This area is. inked green. On sectioning there is a central posterior circumscribed tumor mass within the kidney which. measures 3.3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. It is separated from the posterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of freely. movable membranous tissue. It is 2 cm from the renal hilum and abuts but does not appear to grossly. invade the renal hilar adipose tissue. It does not appear to involve the upper pole calix or the lower pole. calix. Representative sections of the tumor, which has a variegated yellow-tan to dark red appearance are. obtained for research purposes. Following partial fixation representative sections are submitted.

Jar 3. COMMENT. HRG. Histologic sections of the cervical tumor show that it is composed. of large nests of moderately dif.ferentiated stuamous cell. carcinoma with focal keratinisation. In some areas the neoplastic. squamous cells display prominent cytoplasmic clearing, a feature. which was appreciated on this patient's prior biopsy. The growth pattern of the tumor is almost entirely exophytic, a. feature which makes measurement of the depth of invision. difficult. However, the lesion clearly invades the cervical. stroma. The point of deepest invasion occurs at the posterior. cervix (5:00 o'clock), where the tumor invades to a depth of 5 mm. in a 20 mm thick cervix. There is no paracervical soft tissue. present on the posterior cervical wall at this point and the. serosal surface of the cervix therefore represents the margin of. resection. Thus; the most deeply invasive tumor is 15 ram from the. deep surgical resection margin. Prominent vascolar space invasion. is seen. No tumor is identified in the uterine corpus, the vagina,. or the parametrial tissues. Similarly, no tumor is identified in. the 22 regional lymph nodes examined, including two parametrial. --4--.

Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is. designated ""gallbladder"". The specimen consists of a collapsed gallbladder with abundant. fatty tissue around the gallbladder. The gallbladder measures 7.0 cm in length and up to. 2.5 cm in transverse diameter. On opening the gallbladder it contains a small amount of. mucoid bile as well as small fragments of calculus material ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.8. cm. The mucosal surface is green and velvety. The gallbladder wall measures up to 0.2. cm in thickness. A cystic duct lymph node is visible at the proximal resection margin. The proximal resection margin and cystic duct lymph node are submitted in A1. Representative sections from the body and fundus are submitted in A2. B. Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is. designated ""Whipple's specimen"". The specimen consists of a pancreatic duodenectomy. specimen. The duodenal portion measures 32.0 cm in length with a short segment of distal. antrum, 2.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 cm from superior to. inferior, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral and approximately 3.5 cm in thickness from. anterior surface to retroperitoneal resection margin. The superior mesenteric vessel. groove is painted green and the protruding uncinate process is painted orange. The. retroperitoneal soft tissue margin is painted black. The resection margin at the neck. of. the pancreas is painted blue. The ampulla of Vater is somewhat protuberant, measuring. 1.5 cm across with mucosal congestion. The gallbladder is layed open to reveal a firm. tumorous mass encircling the common bile duct starting 0.8 cm from the opening of the. ampulla and extending out the common bile duct for a distance of 2.0 cm. The remaining. proximal common bile duct is 2.5 cm from the proximal extent of the mass. There is. a. bifurcation, likely representing a low insertion of the cystic duct. The bifurcation. lies 1.5 cm from the proximal common bile duct margin. An incision from the uncinate. process aspect at the head of pancreas shows a hard tumorous mass that occupies. approximately 50% of the head of pancreas measuring 3.0 cm from superior to inferior,. approximately 2.0 cm from the wall of the common bile duct in a medial-lateral. orientation and approximately 2.5 cm in thickness in AP orientation. The tumor appears. to lie closest to the retroperitoneal resection margin although soft friable fatty tissue. is present at the surface. The section of the soft tissue around the head of the. pancreas yields a distinct node at the proximal end of the common bile duct, two lymph. nodes along the superior edge of the head of pancreas, approximately four enlarged firm. areas, possibly nodes, in the adipose tissue attached to the distal stomach,. approximately four lymph nodes in the gastroduodenal zone and approximately three lymph. nodes in the fatty tissue at the inferior aspect at the head of pancreas. Sections are taken as follows: B1 - proximal common bile duct resection margin. B2 - resection margin at neck of pancreas. B3 - inferior edge at head of pancreas, perpendicular. B4 through B7 - transverse sections of posterior aspect of pancreatic head from inferior. to superior. B8 through B13 - transverse sections of anterior half of head of pancreas from inferior. to superior. B14 - lymph node at proximal end of cammon bile duct. B15 - lymph nodes at superior edge of head of pancreas. B16 and B17 - lymph nodes on lesser curve of stomach. B18 and B19 - gastroduodenal lymph nodes. B20 - lymph nodes at inferior edge at head of pancreas. B21 - representative section of proximal resection margin, perpendicular. B22 - distal resection margin, perpendicular. Microscopic Description. A. Sections show gallbladder tissue with chronic cholecystitis, but no cytologic atypia. in the mucosa of the gallbladder. The cystic duct lymph node shows accumulation of. macrophages with areas of hyalinization, but without significant mineral oil. lipogranulomatosis. No sign of malignancy is present. B. Sections of the head of pancreas shows an invasive moderate to poorly differentiated. pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that invades along the distal common bile duct, extends. through the wall adjacent duodenum and involves the orifice of the ampulla of Vater.

The specimen is submitted in its. entirety in cassette F. Pathology Resident. Microscopic Description. A: H&E-stained sections of the lymph node show metastatic papillary. thyroid carcinoma with multiple psammoma bodies. B: H&E-stained sections of the thyroid gland show a neoplasm consisting of. branching papillae. The epithelium covering the papillae is comprised of. well differentiated, uniform, orderly cuboidal cells. The neoplastic cells. display finely dispersed chromatin wth intranuclear pseudoincluion and. optically clear nucleus with eccentric nucleolus (Orphan Annie appearance). In addition, occasional nuclear grooves are seen. Scattered psammoma bodies. are identified. The tumor exhibits extracapsular extension, invading into. the surrounding soft tissue, with nests of tumor focally surrounded by dense. fibrosis. The tumor approaches the inked margin; however, the margin is. free of carcinoma. Focally, cystic change is present within the neoplasm. In addition, foreign bodies consistent with suture material are identified,. and are surrounded by reactive fibrosis. The residual uninvolved thyroid. parenchyma is unremarkable. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is. identified (despite multiple tumor metastases in the lymph nodes). Within. the surrounding soft tissue, twelve lymph nodes are identified, and eight of. the lymph nodes are positive for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. (also see below C, D, E and F). C: H&E-stained sections show two lymph nodes with surrounding soft tissue. Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma is present in both lymph nodes. There is metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma present within the soft. tissue. D: H&E-stained sections show two lymph nodes, both of which are positive. for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. One of the lymph nodes shows. extracapsular extension of the carcinoma. E: H&E-stained sections show fifty-nine lymph nodes. Twenty-six lymph. nodes are positive for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Focally,. extracapsular extension is present. There is occasional cystic change. within the lymph nodes. The sternocleidomastoid muscle, jugular vein, and. surrounding soft tissue are otherwise unremarkable.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Specimen (labelled ""left adrenalectomy"") consists of a 45g, ragged and. disrupted piece of firm tan tissue 60 x 35 x 40mm, with a non-intact. capsule. Visible from the external surface are multiple nodular protuberans,. in addition to orangish/yellow portions of ?residual adrenal tissue. One of. the nodules (included in the total measurement) itself measures 26 x 20 x 15mm. and attached by thin membranous tissue only to the bulk of the tissue, and has. a homogenous tan cut surface. The main portion of tissue largely comprises a. nodule 35 x 35 x 30mm, which has a compressed rim of adrenal tissue at one. edge, and has a remaining multinodular appearance with cream specks but. predominantly light tan in colour. (Representative sections: A1&A2 - almost separate nodule; A3-A9 -. representative large tumour mass; A10 - more normal appearing adrenal from one. edge of the lesion with adjacent fibrofatty tissue). Macro Description by: MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sections show a nodular and diffuse adrenocortical tumour. Most of the cells. are generally lipid depleted and are arranged in nests, trabeculae and sheets. There is wide variation in the nuclear size and shape but generally it is. moderate with focal areas showing severe pleomorphism (Fuhrman grade 2-3). Some cells contain PAS positive diastase resistant globules. There are. numerous mitoses (up to 12/10hpf) but atypical mitoses are rare. Extensive. areas of necrosis are present. The nodules are separated by thin and thick. fibrous bands. The tumour has a disrupted fibrous capsula. Tumour cells are seen. infiltrating through the capsule in focal areas. The painted resection margin. is focally involved by tumour cells (blocks A4 & A8). There is evidence of. sinusoidal permeation and endothelial lined space permeation (blocks A4 &. A8). Occasional microscopic foci of infiltration into fatty tissue are seen. Scanty remnant non-neoplastic adrenal tissue is present at the periphery of. the tumour. Thank you for referring this pattent.

[Blocked in toto, 5A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is present but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or. perineural invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no. evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confirmed adjacent to the. tumour. Away from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule. noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells. of Langhans type with surrounding lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis. are present within this nodule. There are two further foci of granulomatous inflammation with. extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophages and fibrosis. These appear to be. centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria. have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confirmed to contain. metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification,. but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflammation. 2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of. pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of. pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections show fragments of lymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic. squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY. Left upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: 1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 68 mm in diameter. Vascular invasion present. No pleural, lymphatic or perineural infiltration seen,. Bronchial and pulmonary artery resection margins clear of malignancy. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in peribronchial lymph nodes. Pathological stage T2 N1. 2: Focally necrotising granulomatous inflammation consistent with atypical Mycobacterial infection. Dr. T-28000 M-80703 M-44700 P1-03000."

Bladder and prostate with attached fibrofatty tissue. The bladder measures. 40mm SI x 35mm ML The prostate measures 30mm SI, 30mm ML x 21mm AP. Attached. fibrofatty tissue measures up to 120mm maximum dimension. No lymph nodes. identified. In the left lateral wall of the bladder there is an ulcerated area 20mm. Underlying this is a hard tumour extending into perivessicular fat, measuring. 25mm SI by approximately 25mm ML. The tumour extends for a depth of 22mm and. is. very close to the left lateral soft tissue circumferential resection margin. Elsewhere, on the right side of the urethral orifice is an area of mucosal. irregularity 15 x 12mm. MICROSCOPY. The tumour seen in the left lateral wall of the bladder is a sarcomatoid variant. of transistional cell carcinoma/high grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumour is. composed predominantly of high grade malignant spindle cells with no. heterologous elements evident. Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is. more reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and. there is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be. arising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat. (pT3) and is 2mm from the circumferential resection margin at its closest point. (block 3B). The macroscopically abnormal area near the bladder neck shows evidence of oedema. and increased vascularity associated with urothelial hyperplasia. There is some. patchy dysplasia in this area which just amounts to CIS in a few foci. The. prostatic urethra shows evidence of similar oedema and increased vascularity. associated with von Brunn's nests and hyperplasia but there is no evidence of. dysplasia and the prostatic resection margin is clear of neoplasia. The prostate, vas deferens and seminal vesicles show no significant abnormality. The left and right distal ureteric resection margins (specimens 1 and 2) show no. definite evidence of carcinoma in situ. SUMMARY. Cystoprostatectomy: Sarcomatoid variant of high grade urothelial carcinoma. (G3,pT3). 2mm clearance from left lateral circumferential resection margin. Adjacent carcinoma-in-situ.

FISH test results are negative for RET/PTC rearrangement. NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E. ) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The. association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary. microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in - -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas. and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF. V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they. have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid. tumors, being found in -40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary. carcinomas (6). 1.

Specimens with the minimum of 50% of. tumor. cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the. platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting. curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was. considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal. DNA. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PART 1: THYROID, TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY (22 GRAMS) -. A.

Internal positive control is positive. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein. over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed. that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All. carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of. the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of. immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. HER2/neu.

Sections examined show a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesion within the skeletal muscle of this excisional biopsy. The capsule shows areas of entrapped smooth muscle fibres, reminiscent of a large muscular vessel. The intravascular. lesion is heterogenous with multiple lobules of variable cellularity. There is palisading of the hypercellular areas around. central areas of pauci-cellularity. Some of the central areas show fibrin collections. At the periphery of the lesion, there. are many anastomosing thin-walled vessels surrounded by a myxoid spindle-cell proliferation with tissue-culture pattern. There is extensive mixed inflammation throughout the lesion including predominantly small lymphocytes and plasma cells. The spindle cells are bland with dispersed chromatin. Occasional multinucleated cells are noted. Throughout the lesion,. there are only rare mitotic figures (<1 per 10 HPF). A previous scar with hemosiderin deposition and reparative changes. is present, consistent with previous biopsy procedure. Movat pentachrome stain highlights the remnant large vessel and. the myxoid change within the lesion. On immunohistochemistry, the cells are positive for SMA and negative for caldesmon, desmin, and CD34. hows. focal areas with some entrapped positive spindle cells but is negative in the main spindle cell population.

Parts of the tumor. are highly positive for synaptophysin and NSE and negative for chromatogranin, S-100 and. CK20. Parts of the tumor are highly positive for P53. The immunohistochemical marker constellation also confirms the diagnosis of small-cell. urothelial carcinoma already communicated."

COMMENT: The invasive tumor present in e-right breast (specimen) shows a morphology that is. predominantly that of lobular carcinoma. In many areas, however, and particularly on slide A5 the. tumor shows small tubular structures with angulated contours and apocrine snouting. This combined. morphology is that of tubulolobular carcinoma. This tumor was e-cadherin positive on the original. biopsy, a finding that normally favors ductal carcinoma. Tubulolobular carcinoma, however, has been. reported to be e-cadherin positive also. Since the WHO currently includes tubulolobular carcinoma as. a variant of lobular carcinoma, that is how it is listed on the synoptic template since there is no option for. tubulolobular carcinoma in that template.

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.7 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate. of lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph. nodes to reveal 8 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 2.7 x 1.5. X 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as. follows: B1: 3 lymph node candidates. B2: One lymph node, bisected. B3: One lymph node, bisected. B4: One lymph node, bisected. B5: One lymph node, bisected. B6-B7: One lymph node, sectioned. C. The third container is additionally identified as, ""bladder, prostate, vas. deferens"". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 396.8 gm, 15.0 x 12.0 x. 4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder. measures 9.5 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and. probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4.5 x 0.4 cm and the left 4.5 x. 0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.5 x 4.0 x. 3.5 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left. half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and. continued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is. serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal unremarkable, bulging yellow-tan. parenchyma without indurations; there is periurethral nodularity. The bladder. demonstrates an area of ulceration with underlying induration on the right. posterolateral wall that measures 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mucosal surface overlying. this induration has a flattened, granular appearance. Serial sectioning reveals. tumor invasion to within 0.2 cm of the inked margin, and grossly apparent. invasion into the muscularis propria. Adjacent to this area of ulceration and. induration, toward the left posterolateral wall, there is a poorly defined area. of mucosa with a granular appearance without prominent papillary excrescences;. the tissue underlying this granular mucosa is somewhat indurated. The remainder. of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform 2.5 cm wall. thickness. The external surface of the bladder is red-tan and glistening with no. grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: C1: Distal urethral margin.

Its. proximal end is still attached to the terminal ileum (4 cm long with a 3.0 cm circumference). The. appendix is 6 cm long with a 0.6 cm diameter. There is a cecal mucosa based mass, 7cm from the. terminal ileum margin and 11 cm from the distal colonic margin. Both margins are free of tumor or any. additional findings. The mass is exophytic, tan color, with a rolled edge, which is sharply defined from. the adjacent mucosa. The mass is also circular and measures 4.0 cm in diameter and < 1 cm in depth.

COMMENT: The liver nodule shows a proliferation of relatively bland epithelioid cells separated by a. fibrovascular stroma. Unfortunately, the tissue is largely absent on permanent sections and can only be. seen well on the frozen section. Ancillary studies like IHC are not possible. The epithelioid cells may. represent histiocytes or potentially a hyperplastic mesothelial proliferation. There is no evidence of. carcinoma, and I favor a benign process in this nodule. Correlation with clinical findings is. recommended. Microsatellite instability testing has been ordered on the colon tumor. Those results will be issued in a. separate report.

The tumor is located in the right. anterior, mid anterior, left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid. posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor. occupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 X 3.0 cm in the largest. cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base. regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the. prostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level. At the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the. right posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal. involvement cannot be excluded. The tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions. Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes. GROSS DESCRIPTION. Page: 4.

The nodules are composed of sheets and. focal trabecular arrangements of atypical cells. The mostly polygonal cells show marked variability in size. There. are many very large cells with bizarre nuclei. Most of the cells show clear cytoplasm with distinct cell borders. In the. more trabecular areas, the cells are smaller with more eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures, including atypical. ones, are common. The parenchymal resection margin is negative for tumor. No lymphovascular Invasion is seen. The tumor abuts, but does not penetrate, the liver capsule. The hepatic parenchyma away from the mass shows a. minimal lymphocytic infiltrate of the portal tracts. No notable fibrosis is seen by H&E. There is no suggestion of. nodularity. No lobular activity is appreciated. Many of the hepatocytes have brown granular pigment. B. Along the serosal surface, adjacent to a minimal amount of hepatic parenchyma, is a thin, fibrous cyst wall. which is lined by a single layer of low cuboidal to flattened, bland epithelial cells. The gallbladder mucosa shows a. minimal lymphocytic infiltrate. There is no dysplasia or malignancy."

Sections through the Ampulla show apancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma secondarily involving the. Ampulla and common bile duct. A precursor lesion for the carcinoma is not identified in the Ampulla,. duodenum or bile duct. The carcinoma, however, is centered on the main pancreatic duct.

GROSS DESCRIPTION. imen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled with the patient's name. left renal mass"" and consists of a 6.5 X 5.5 X 5 cm red-brown portion of partial neprirectomy. The surrace of the kidney overlying the tumor is inked in green. The entire normal kidney margin is inked. in black. The estimated tumor size is 3 X 2 X 2 cm. The cut surface is not homogeneous with areas of. dark brown tumor admixed with foci of lighter tan friable tumor. Representative sections are frozen as. FSA1 and FSA2. The remainder of tissue. are submitted in cassettes (A1) and (A2),. respectively. Representative sections submitted in cassette (A3)-(A9). SLIDE KEY: A1 - remainder of tissue from FSA1. A2 - remainder of tissue from FSA2. A3-A6 - sections with tumor. A7 - normal-appearing kidney. A8-A9 - additional sections of margins near tumor. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Renal mass, left: ""Deep and renal capsule margins within a few microns. Renal carcinoma, classification. pending permanent section."". MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Permanent sections show a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with areas of solid proliferation. without papillary structures. The lesion has a pseudocapsule, and it appears to be resected with. approximately 0.4 mm distance between the tumor and the normal kidney resection plane. The papillary. appearance is more pronounced at the periphery of the tumor. Nuclei are bland and are consistent with. Fuhrman grade 1 without evidence of nucleoli. The cells in the solid areas have some kind of an. eosinophilic matrix with occasional globoid bodies. Mitotic figures are rare, and in some areas, there is. the appearance of pseudorosette formation. The lesion contains some calcium. In slide A-6, there are. good psammoma bodies represented. The nearby renal parenchyma appears to be normal. Vascular or. lymphatic invasion is not observed. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES: These are carried out to evaluate the solid areas of the tumor. The controls are appropriate, and the. following results are obtained: Synaptophysin - negative. Chromogranin - negative. Keratin cocktail - there is 1-2+ reactivity. CK7 - there is 1+ staining of the cytoplasm. Vimentin - there is good vimentin staining, about 2-3+. CD10 - negative. COMMENT: We are dealing with an unusual variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with solid areas and presence of. low-grade nuclei indicating that this would fit a type 1 papillary carcinoma which is associated with. a. better survival rate than classic clear renal cell carcinomas. The lesion appears to be resected although. it. is close to the resection plane, at least focally. as reviewed the slide and concurs. A. neuroendocrine component has been excluded.

NOTE: Nucleic acids were extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. Amplification of GAPDH and KRT7 controls was. acceptable. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. (1). BRAF V600E ( mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papiliary carcinoma (2) and may be. used for preoperative risk stratification of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (3). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg. rearrangement occur in -70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinomas (4). Based on a recent prospective study of FNA samples (5) and our experience at UPMC, detection of BRAF mutations and. RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements in thyroid FNA samples correlated with - -100% probability of cancer, whereas. detection of RAS mutation correlated with malignancy in 83-87% of cases and with benign follicular adenoma or hyperplastic. nodule in 13-17%. However, single cases of false-positive BRAF mutation detection in thyroid FNA samples have been reported in. the literature (6) and therefore the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in combination with clinical information,. imaging, and cytology.

ADDENDA: Addendum. Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing: Block 3A, microdisgection target 1 (T1) : A. Losa of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 5q (378). B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 8% (1 locus with losa/12 informative loci). Block 4B, microdissection target 2 (T2). A. Loss of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 1p (32%). B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 81 (1 locus with loss/12 informative loci). Note: LOH of high amplitude is considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is. affected. Loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in. liver neoplasias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in the. literature, benign neoplasme (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia). typically have low frequency of LOH (mean fractional allelic loss ~6$) and. hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOH (mean. fractional allele loss -30%) (1,2) Some studies have shown that HCC with. FAL of <30 are associated with indolent biological behavior and FAL of >30%. with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5) LOK mutations are reported as. high amplitude when more than 75% of cellular DNA ie affected. Some HCC with. low amplitude LOH mutations and FAL 25-35 t considered to be indeterminate. biological behavior. However, not all cumors reveal auch a correlation and,. therefore, the LOH profile should be interpreted in the context of the. cytologic and histologic findings and the patient s clinical history. Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis. Manual microdicsection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor. tissue and normal adjacent tissue (if available) or a blood sampla. DNA was. isclated using standard laboratory procedure. Specimeno with the minimium of. 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Eighteen microsatellite markers (listed below) that have been previously found. to be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor. suppressor genes were used for analysis. PCR was performed using. fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected. using capillary electrophoresis on ABI3730 platform. Relative fluorescence was. determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the. patient 19 neterozygous at the marker (genetically informative) and neoplastic. tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for. significant allelic imbalance were determined using normal (non-neoplastic). specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /. NS). (TL/TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker. was below 0.5 or above 2.0. When normal tissue was not available, peak height. ratios falling outside of 2 SDs beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele. paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity. D19407. 1p36.

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57. copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by. 1 with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION. The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12). The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu. levels: > 2.20. (Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43). NOTES. The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP. 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1-q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.

Specimen E is labeled ""anterior margin"" and measures 4.5 X 2.7 X. 0.8 cm. Tissue was received with a stitch on one side and is. brown and smooth and inked blue. The opposite side is brown with. focal areas of cauterization and inked black. Sectioning reveals. brown unremarkable liver parenchyma. The specimen is entirely. submitted in block E1-E6,. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. The sections show hepatocellular carcinoma involving the portal. tract margin (B1) the surgical margin in specimen B and also. the separately submitted medial (specimen D) and anterior. margins (specimen E) . The carcinoma is detached in specimen D. and uninked; therefore, the carcinoma in this specimen cannot be. oriented as to old versus new margin in specimen D. In specimen. E, the carcinoma involves both the old and the new margin. Stains are performed on the portal tract margin (B1) and the. carcinoma in this section is positive for glypican 3 and shows. widened trabeculae by reticulin staining. The. immunohistochemistry is supportive of portal tract margin. involvement in Specimen B. The hepatocellular carcinoma abuts capsule with an overlying. fibrous serosal adhesion, reactive mesothelial cells and. hemosiderin laden macrophages. Immunohistochemistry is performed. on the section with capsule (B4) . HEPAR-1 is negative within the. fibrous adhesion and calretinin highlights reactive mesothelial. cells. The carcinoma abuts capsule; but no diagnostic. involvement of capsule is identified. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows both trabecular and. pseudoglandular (acinar) architecture. Immunohistochemistry is. performed on a representative section of carcinoma (B5) . HEPAR-1. stains a subset including the gland forming areas. Glypican 3 is positive. CK7 is positive in a subset including. both the glandular and non-glandular architecture. CD5 is. negative. The findings are consistent with a hepatocellular. carcinoma with areas of pseudoglandular architecture. No. adenocarcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal. carcinoma) is identified. The background liver is cirrhotic with mild steatosis K< 10%,. predominately macrovesicular) No definite active. steatohepatitis is identified. Special stains are performed on. the representative uninvolved liver (B8) . Reticulin and. trichrome highlight stage 4 fibrosis. Iron highlights scattered. iron within hepatocytes and mostly within Kupffer cells. PASD. stains macrophages in sinusoidal areas, and is negative for. alpha-1 antitrypsin particles. In the cecal margin block of specimen A (A2) there is apparent. detached benign appearing liver tissue. HEPAR- is positive in. these detached fragments confirming liver in this section. This. may represent floater versus adhesion to liver. No carcinoma is. identified in the proximal cecal margin."

A: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""lymph node no 8"" and contains a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm tan. yellow ovoid portion of tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. On sectioning,. the. lymph node is firm, white, and grossly suspicious. The trisected lymph node is submitted. entirely in A1 and A2. B: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""portal lymph nodes"" and contains an irregular heavily. cauterized, 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm greyish tan tissue fragment. The fragment is bisected and. submitted in toto in B1. C: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""gallbladder"" and contains an intact unopened 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. gallbladder. The gallbladder serosa is smooth and shiny without nodules or adhesions,. and the adventitial surface is slightly roughened. The cystic duct is open. The cystic. duct margin is inked black. A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm plump ovoid cystic duct lymph node is. present. The gallbladder lumen contains viscous green bile and no gallstones. The. gallbladder wall is thin, pliable, and approximately 2 mm thick. The gallbladder mucosa. is green and velvety with marked yellow speckling suggestive of cholesterolosis. There. are no polyps, masses or other lesions. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: C1. bisected cystic duct lymph node and black - inked cystic duct margin. C2. two representative sections of gallbladder mucosa, one from near gallbladder. neck and. one from fundus. D: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The. container is designated ""Whipple's specimen"" and contains a 23 cm long portion of. duodenum with attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of the pancreatic head. The duodenum. has an average linear circumference of 4 cm, and the distal 13 cm of the duodenum shows. dusky ischemic discoloration. The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds,. without polyps or other lesions. The retroperitoneal margin (designated with a blue. suture) is inked blue and the SMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin. is. inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck. margin, but the duct appears occluded less than 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of. the head of the pancreas, there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery. tan white mass with infiltrative borders. On sectioning, the central portion of the mass. contains numerous cystic spaces filled with thin clear mucin. Grossly, the mass abuts. the retroperitoneal margin and the SMA groove but does not clearly involve those margins. The mass closely abuts the common bile duct, which contains a metal stent. The mass also. approaches to the level of the ampulla, but does not invade the wall of the duodenum. Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding peripancreatic fat, a few of which. are slightly enlarged and firm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1. proximal duodenal margin. D2. distal duodenal margin. D3. bile duct margin. D4. tumor with pancreatic neck margin. D5-7. three contiguous sections of tumor showing relationship of tumor with common. bile duct. and retroperitoneal margin.

E: The specimen consists of pink tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in. toto in E1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container designated. ""pancreas neck"". The previously frozen tissue is entirely resubmitted for permanent. sections in EQS1. Frozen Section Diagnosis. E: Pancreatic Neck: Chronic inflammation with some dilated ducts. No malignancy in the sampled. sections. Pathologist Comment. E. Permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin (i.e. slide E1-2) reveal rare. crushed atypical cells, present in pools of mucin surrounding a nerve, highly suspicious. for adenocarcinoma. These cells are not definitively identified in the original frozen. section slides. Since the frozen section represents the ""true"" margin, and the permanent. sections are cut from deeper (more distal) tissue, it is estimated that the true. pancreatic neck margin is negative but that tumor extends very close (likely 1-2 mm) to. this margin.

Opening the prostate and bladder anteriorly reveals a ulcerated and centrally. necrotic tan-white tumor (12 x 9.5 x 3.2 cm) involving the entire right half of the. bladder wall and extending to the dome, posterior wall, and inferiorly to the right. anterior proximal prostate. Tumor diffusely replaces the bladder wall and extends. into the perivesical fat with thickness of 3.2 cm. Tumor comes within 1 mm of the. inked right resection margin. The mucosa beyond the central ulceration is granular. and the uninvolved left lateral wall mucosa is edematous and smooth. The right-. ureter is impinged upon by tumor for a length of 2 cm from the ureterovesical. junction. The mucosa of the bilateral ureters is otherwise unremarkable.

Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled ""Lung Bx, frozen section' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent. [Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and. peribronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection. margin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid. area of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying. pleura, 2I; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (?.

[Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12. mm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, 5A.]. MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen.

The sections show a lymph node laden with histiocytes containing carbon. pigment. Within the subcapsular sinus, there is one small focus of metastatic. mesothelioma, less than 1mm, with focal extra capsular extension to a distance. of less than 0. 5mm. B. The sections show shows a lymph node with one small focus, . 5mm, of. metastatic malignant mesothelioma. C. Multiple sections of the left extrapleural pneumonectomy were taken,. including the various resection margins from anterior and posterior pericardium,. anterior, posterior, lateral and medial diaphragm, parietal pleura and. mediastinal fat. The sections confirm malignant mesothelioma exhibiting. predominantly an epithelial growth pattern with a very small component. (5%). of. sarcomatous pattern. The vast majority of the tumour is characterised by. pavement-like sheets of large cells often exhibiting a microcystic growth. pattern with focal necrosis. There is abundant pale basophilic material,. confirmed to be hyaluronate on an Alcian blue/hyaluronidase stain. The malignant. cells possess monotonous, round to oval to mildly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei,. prominent nucleoli and abundant, often vacuolated cytoplasm. In focal areas the. cells exhibit a spindled morphology, intermixed with moderate amounts of dense. collagen. Lymphovascular space invasion is noted. There is extensive involvement of all parietal pleural resection margins. Tumour lies close to the anterior pericardial resection margin, as well as the. anterior, posterior, medial and lateral diaphragmatic resection margins. There. is subpleural extension into lung and extension to the internal surface of. the. pericardium. The sections also confirm invasion of the mediastinal fat. The. bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour and there is no invasion of the. bronchial tree at the hilum (described macroscopically). Of eight hilar lymph. nodes retrieved, one small lymph node shows near complete replacement by. metastatic tumour with extracapsular extension to a distance of 0. 5mm. D. The sections show a lymph node with abundant histiocytes containing carbon. pigment. There is no evidence of micrometastasis identified by light microscopy. CONCLUSION: A. Bronchial lymph node: Micrometastasis, less than 1mm, of metastatic. mesothelioma, with focal extracapsular extension. B. Mediastinal lymph node: Micrometastasis, of malignant mesothelioma. C. Extrapleural pneumonectomy: 1. Extensive involvement by malignant mesothelioma, predominantly of. epithelial pattern, with focal (5 % or less) sarcomatous pattern. 2. Tumour lies focally close to anterior pericardial resection margin and. anterior, posterior, medial and lateral diaphragmatic resection margins. There. is subpleural invasion of the lung parenchyma and extension to the internal. surface of the pericardium. Involvement beyond the parietal pleural margin is. extensive with invasion into mediastinal fat. Bronchial resection margin is. clear of tumour. 3. Of eight hilar lymph nodes, one is. positive with focal extracapsular. extension (1/8). D. Thymic lymph node: Negative for malignancy, no micrometastases.

Block Number: D2. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 10%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (. i using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: -year-old female with abnormal screening mammogram of right breast at right upper outer quadrant. Needle biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma. Patient then had MRI which showed enhancement of. upper outer quadrant and upper inner quadrant; anteriorly there was enhancement 2 cm from clip and. close to nipple. PET, CT and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease. Invasive ductal. carcinoma SBR grade 2, ER positive, PR positive, Her2/neu negative. Tumor size 0.4 cm, also with high. grade DCIS solid and cribriform with necrosis and extension to lobules. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right Breast Cancer. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology. Core Facility by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI. Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No:NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.05. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. ONCOTYPE DX BREAST CANCER ASSAY.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative. blocks of axillary. lymph nodes (C6 and C7) and the results are as follows: CD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular. distribution. CD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of. the paracortex. Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal. pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph. nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and. a. paracortex. populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph. nodes and do not. support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild. paracortical. expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic. lymphadenopathy."

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Lung cancer. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe lung and is received without fixative. It consists of a. lobectomy of lung weighing 163 grams. The lobe measures 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Just superior to the hilum. of this lobectomy specimen, there is a wedge resection of additional lung suggestive of apical portion of. right lower lobe. This adherent wedge resection measures 8 X 2.5 X 2 cm. The pleural surface of the. upper lobe varies from tan to violet and appears smooth with very little anthracotic stippling. Where the. lung wedge is adherent to the mid portion of the upper lobe, there is palpable firmness and slight. retraction of the pulmonary parenchyma. The wedge resection is similarly adherent to the pleural surface. of the lower portion of the upper lobe. A metallic staple line runs from the hilum of the lung along the. inferior edge of the upper lobe and is 11 cm in length. The pleural surface overlying the adherent lung. wedge and in the vicinity of the palpable firmness is inked blue. The staple line along the lung wedge is. dissected free and the resection edge is inked green. On sectioning of this area of palpable firmness,. there is a relatively well-circumscribed tan to pale yellow neoplasm which overall measures 3.5 x 3.5 X. 2.9 cm. This neoplasm abuts the pleural surface of the upper lobe and passes across the interlobar fissure. between the upper lobe and the apical portion of the lower lobe, to involve the adherent wedge resection. This neoplasm is 0.5 cm from the closest bronchial margin, abuts the pleural surface in several areas, and. is 0.4 cm from the stapled resection margin of the apical portion of the lower lobe. Sections of the. remaining lung reveal pale red pulmonary parenchyma which appears relatively well-aerated. At the. hilum of the lung, there are two 0.5-0.7 cm peribronchial dull red nodes. Dissection of the major bronchi. reveal no intrabronchial tumor. The neoplasm is 6 cm or greater from the inferior staple line. Representative neoplasm is obtained in its fresh state for research purposes. Following fixation,. representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial resection margins, A2) vascular. margins, A3) peribronchial nodes, A4-A5) tumor and pleural surface of upper lobe, A6) additional section. of tumor and upper lobe, A7-A8) full longitudinal cross-section extending from upper lobe into adherent. lower lobe wedge, including wedge resection margin, A9) tumor adjacent to upper lobe segmental. bronchus, A10) sections of upper lobe parenchyma away from tumor, A11) sections of wedge of lower. lobe away from tumor, A12) sections of inferior upper lobe along staple line.

Subcapsular nodule c/w colonic adenocarcinoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION. A. Received fresh in a container labeled ""sigmoid colon"". is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at. one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the. opposite end, which is inked blue. It is 5 cm in circumference. at. the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the. stapled end of the specimen. The serosal surface is generally. tan-pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm. from the open end of the specimen. There is a palpable mass within. the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor. penetration to the serosal surface. The specimen is opened,. revealing a near circumferential 7.5 X 6.5 X 1.5 cm mass lesion,. coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen. On cut. suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the. bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is. not near the radial margin. The mucosa away from this area is area. is tan-pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3. cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. There is no other worrisome. lesion in the bowel. The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple. soft tan-pink lymph nodes are identified. RS-16, according to the. accompanying block summary, following fixation. BLOCK SUMMARY: A1 - proximal and distal resection margins; A2-A6 -. polyps; A7 - radial margin; A8-A10 - tumor; A11-A15 - lymph nodes,. h multiple lymph nodes per block; A16 - one sectioned lymph node. B. Received fresh in a container labeled ""segment for. liver lesion"" is a wedge-shaped portion of tissue, with. a. generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of. tan-white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the. non-capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and. cauterized. The specimen spans an area 2 X 1.5 X 1.1 cm. On cut. surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest. extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton. noted on the capsular surface. Two sections are submitted for. frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFS1, and the. remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one. additional block. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. The following template summarizes the findings in this case: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma of the colon. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) : Adenocarcinoma invades through the full. thickness of the bowel wall into surrounding adipose tissue (pT3). Proximal margin: Negative. Distal margin: Negative. Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative. Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description. Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : pNO . Twenty-two lymph nodes are. identified, and they are negative for malignancy. Distant metastasis (pM) : pM1. There is metastatic colonic. adenocarcinoma in part B. Other findings: There are multiple hyperplastic polyps and an. adenomatous polyp in the colon away from the mass lesion. The liver. outside the metastasis is notable for steatosis with mild chronic. inflammation and a slight increase in fibrous tissue, though this. is difficult to assess given the supcapsular nature of the biopsy. and being adjacent to the metastasis. There no significant. stainable iron. Please note that in part B, in addition to. examining H&E stained sections, PAS, PAS-diastase, trichrome,. reticulin, and iron-stained sections are examined. 5,4,14,15,18x5. DIAGNOSIS. A.

Microscopic Examination. #1 Microscopic examination performed. #2 Sections of the pancreatic mass demonstrate a well differentiated pancreatic. ductal adenocarcinoma composed of irregular glandular structures lined by a. malignant cell population with nuclear pleomorphism and nucleoli formation. The. adenocarcinoma extends into the peripancreatic soft tissue and is less than 0.1. cm away from the retroperitoneal margin. However, some of the retroperitoneal. margin sections contain significant cautery artifact which blurs the. retroperitoneal margin sections. The bile duct, proximal stomach, distal. duodenum and pancreatic margins are all free of adenocarcinoma. The. adenocarcinoma extends into the duodenum and extensively involves the duodenum. as well as the ampulla. In the ampullary section, there is lymphovascular space. invasion beneath the mucosal surface of the ampulla. Extensive perineural. invasion is noted. Sections labeled ""2M"" of the peripancreatic lymph nodes. demonstrate metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes. The remaining. lymph node sections, (""2N"", ""20"") are free of adenocarcinoma. There is. metastatic adenocarcinoma in a total of two of thirteen lymph nodes.

INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS. Test. Description. Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in two containers labeled with the patient's name . A. Container A is received fresh for frozen section, additionally labeled 'right sentinel node' and contains a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of yellow-tan. fibrofatty soft tissue. On palpation, a 1.3 cm firm fatty nodule is identified consistent with possible lymph node. The nodule is bisected and entirely. submitted for frozen section. The residual is entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A labeled. B. Container B is received with formalin additionally labeled 'right breast tissue' and consists of a 1439.4 gram, 27.5 x 19.0 x 6.5 cm simple mastectomy. specimen partially surfaced by pink-tan wrinkled skin which bears a central 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm slightly raised nipple. Orientation is not offered or possible. Located 0.7 cm from the skin edge and 7.8 cm from the nipple is a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm gray-brown raised skin lesion. Additional skin lesions are not. identified. The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8: x 1.5 x 1.0 cm cystic lesion containing pink-tan friable soft. tissue, along with a radiographic clip. This lesion resides 4.5 cm from the skin surface and 2.2 cm from the inked deep margin. Multiple additional pink-. tan rubbery lesions are identified diffusely scattered throughout the specimen and involve all four quadrants. The largest of these remaining lesions is. 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm and approaches to within 0.4 cm of the inked deep margin. The uninvolved areas are comprised of yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed. with moderate amounts of interspersed gray-white fibrous tissue. Discrete axillary tail is not present, however, five firm fatty possible lymph nodes are. identified along one edge of the specimen. These possible lymph nodes range from 1.0 up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Also received in the same container are two portions of pink-tan wrinkled skin with yellow-tan subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue. These tissues are 8.0 x. 2.0 x 1.3 cm and 16.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.The cut surfaces are yellow-tan fibrofattywith no discrete lesions.
